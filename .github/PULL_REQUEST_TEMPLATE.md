- [ ] Add new public functions/methods/classes to `doc/api/index.rst`.
- [ ] Write detailed docstrings for all functions/methods.
- [ ] If wrapping a new module, open a 'Wrap new GMT module' issue and submit reasonably-sized PRs.
- [ ] If adding new functionality, add an example to docstrings or tutorials.
- [ ] Use underscores (not hyphens) in names of Python files and directories.
