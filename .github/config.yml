  Please make sure you read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and abide by our [code of conduct](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

  A few things to keep in mind:

  * If you need help writing tests, take a look at the existing ones for inspiration. If you don't know where to start, let us know and we'll walk you through it.
  * All new features should be documented. It helps to write the docstrings for your functions/classes before writing the code. This will help you think about your code design and results in better code.
  * No matter what, we are really grateful that you put in the effort to do this! 🎉
