# Cache GMT remote data files and upload as artifacts
#
# This workflow downloads data files needed by PyGMT tests/documentation from
# the GMT data server and uploads as workflow artifacts which can be accessed
# by other GitHub Actions workflows.
#
# It is scheduled to run every Sunday at 12:00 (UTC). If new remote files are
# needed urgently, maintainers can update the workflow file or the
# 'pygmt/helpers/caching.py' file to refresh the cache.
