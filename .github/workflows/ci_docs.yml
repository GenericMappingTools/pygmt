# Build and deploy documentation
#
# This workflow builds the documentation on Linux/macOS/Windows.
#
# It is run on every commit to the main and pull request branches, and also when a new
# release is published. In draft pull requests, only the job on Linux is triggered to
# save on Continuous Integration resources.
#
# On the main branch, the workflow also handles the documentation deployment:
#
# * Updating the development documentation by pushing the built HTML pages from the main
#   branch onto the dev folder of the gh-pages branch.
# * Updating the latest documentation link to the new release.
