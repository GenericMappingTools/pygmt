# Build and deploy documentation
#
# This workflow builds the documentation on Linux/macOS/Windows.
#
# It is run on every commit to the main and pull request branches, and also
# when a new release is published.
# In draft pull requests, only the job on Linux is triggered to save on
# Continuous Integration resources.
#
# On the main branch, the workflow also handles the documentation deployment:
#
# * Updating the development documentation by pushing the built HTML pages
#   from the main branch onto the dev folder of the gh-pages branch.
# * Updating the latest documentation link to the new release.
