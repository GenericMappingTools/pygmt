# Tests PyGMT on Linux/macOS/Windows
#
# This workflow runs regular PyGMT tests and uploads test coverage reports stored
# in `.coverage.xml` to https://app.codecov.io/gh/GenericMappingTools/pygmt
# via the [Codecov GitHub Action](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action).
# More codecov related configurations are stored in `.github/codecov.yml`.
# If any tests fail, it also uploads the diff images as workflow artifacts.
#
# It is run:
# 1. on every commit to the main branch
# 2. on every commit to the pull request branches, unless the pull requests only
#    contain non-code changes.
# 3. when a new release is published
#
# It is also scheduled to run daily on the main branch.
#
# In draft pull request, only two jobs on Linux are triggered to save on
# Continuous Integration resources:
#
# - Minimum [NEP29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy) Python/NumPy versions
# - Latest Python/NumPy versions + optional packages (e.g. GeoPandas)
