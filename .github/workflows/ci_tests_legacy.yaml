# Test PyGMT with GMT legacy versions on Linux/macOS/Windows
#
# This workflow runs regular PyGMT tests with GMT legacy versions. Due to the
# minor baseline image changes between GMT versions, the workflow only runs
# the tests but doesn't do image comparisons.
#
# It is scheduled to run every Tuesday on the main branch.
