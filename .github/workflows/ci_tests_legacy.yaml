# Test PyGMT with GMT legacy versions and old Python dependencies on Linux/macOS/Windows
#
# This workflow runs regular PyGMT tests with GMT legacy versions and old versions of
# all optional and required Python dependencies. Due to minor baseline image changes
# between GMT versions, the workflow runs the tests but doesn't do image comparisons.
#
# It is scheduled to run every Tuesday on the main branch.
