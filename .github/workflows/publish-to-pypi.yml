# Publish archives to PyPI and TestPyPI using GitHub Actions
#
# This workflow is ran to publish PyGMT archives (source and binary distributions)
# to TestPyPI (for testing only) and PyPI.
#
# Archives will be pushed to TestPyPI for every commit to the main branch and
# tagged releases, and to PyPI for tagged releases only.
#
# Note that authentication to TestPyPI/PyPI is done via OpenID Connect, see also
# https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish/tree/release/v1#publishing-with-openid-connect
#
# Important: this workflow filename must be publish-to-pypi.yml to match the
# settings in PyPI and TestPyPI so that OIDC publishing works.
