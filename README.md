## Why PyGMT?

A beautiful map is worth a thousand words. To truly understand how powerful PyGMT is,
play with it online on [Binder](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/try-gmt)! For a
quicker introduction, check out our [3 minute overview](https://youtu.be/4iPnITXrxVU)!

Afterwards, feel free to look at our [Tutorials](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/tutorials),
visit the [Gallery](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/gallery), and check out some
[external PyGMT examples](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/external_resources.html)!

## About

PyGMT is a library for processing geospatial and geophysical data and making
publication-quality maps and figures. It provides a Pythonic interface for the
[Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt), a command-line
program widely used across the Earth, Ocean, and Planetary sciences and beyond.

## Project goals

- Make GMT more accessible to new users.
- Build a Pythonic API for GMT.
- Interface with the GMT C API directly using ctypes (no system calls).
- Support for rich display in the Jupyter notebook.
- Integration with the [scientific Python ecosystem](https://scientific-python.org/):
  `numpy.ndarray` or `pandas.DataFrame` for data tables, `xarray.DataArray` for grids,
  and `geopandas.GeoDataFrame` for geographical data.

## Quickstart

### Installation

Simple installation using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.org/):

```bash
mamba install --channel conda-forge pygmt
```

If you use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html):

```bash
conda install --channel conda-forge pygmt
```

For other ways to install `pygmt`, see the [full installation instructions](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/install.html).

### Getting started

As a starting point, you can open a [Python interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html)
or a [Jupyter notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html), and try the
following example:

``` python
import pygmt
fig = pygmt.Figure()
fig.coast(projection="N15c", region="g", frame=True, land="tan", water="lightblue")
fig.text(position="MC", text="PyGMT", font="80p,Helvetica-Bold,red@75")
fig.show()
```

You should see a global map with land and water masses colored in tan and lightblue,
respectively. On top, there should be the semi-transparent text "PyGMT". For more examples,
please have a look at the [Gallery](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/gallery/index.html) and
[Tutorials](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/tutorials/index.html).

### Code of conduct

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

### Contributing guidelines

Please read our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to see how you can help and give feedback.

### Imposter syndrome disclaimer

**We want your help.** No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not ready
to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good enough to
contribute. What could you possibly offer?

We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code.** Equally important contributions
include: writing or proof-reading documentation, suggesting or implementing tests, or
even giving feedback about the project (including giving feedback about the contribution
process). If you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, you might see the errors and
assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over. If you can write any code at
all, you can contribute code to open source. We are constantly trying out new skills,
making mistakes, and learning from those mistakes. That's how we all improve and we are
happy to help others learn.

To cite a specific version of PyGMT, go to our Zenodo page at <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3781524>
and use the "Export to BibTeX" function there. It is also strongly recommended to cite
the [GMT 6 paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GC008515) (which PyGMT wraps around). Note
that some modules like `dimfilter`, `surface`, and `x2sys` also have their dedicated
citations. Further information for all these can be found at <https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/cite>.
