About
-----

PyGMT is a library for processing geospatial and geophysical data and making
publication quality maps and figures. It provides a Pythonic interface for the
`Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) <https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt>`__, a
command-line program widely used in the Earth Sciences.

Project goals
-------------

* Make GMT more accessible to new users.
* Build a Pythonic API for GMT.
* Interface with the GMT C API directly using ctypes (no system calls).
* Support for rich display in the Jupyter notebook.
* Integration with the `PyData <https://pydata.org/>`__ ecosystem:
  ``numpy.ndarray`` or ``pandas.DataFrame`` for data tables,
  ``xarray.DataArray`` for grids and ``geopandas.GeoDataFrame``
  for geographical data.


Quickstart
----------

Installation
++++++++++++

Simple installation using `conda <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html>`__::

    conda install --channel conda-forge pygmt

If you use `mamba <https://mamba.readthedocs.org/>`__::

    mamba install --channel conda-forge pygmt

For other ways to install ``pygmt``, see `full installation instructions <https://www.pygmt.org/latest/install.html>`__.


Contacting Us
-------------

* Most discussion happens `on GitHub
  <https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt>`__. Feel free to `open an issue
  <https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt/issues/new>`__ or comment on any
  open issue or pull request.
* We have a `Discourse forum
  <https://forum.generic-mapping-tools.org/c/questions/pygmt-q-a>`__ where you can ask
  questions and leave comments.

Code of conduct
+++++++++++++++

Please note that this project is released with a `Contributor Code of Conduct
<https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`__.
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

Contributing Guidelines
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Please read our `Contributing Guide
<https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`__ to
see how you can help and give feedback.

Imposter syndrome disclaimer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**We want your help.** No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not ready
to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good enough to
contribute. What could you possibly offer?

We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code**.
Equally important contributions include: writing or proof-reading documentation,
suggesting or implementing tests, or even giving feedback about the project (including
giving feedback about the contribution process). If you're coming to the project with
fresh eyes, you might see the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have
glossed over. If you can write any code at all, you can contribute code to open source.
We are constantly trying out new skills, making mistakes, and learning from those
mistakes. That's how we all improve and we are happy to help others learn.

To cite a specific version of PyGMT, go to our Zenodo page at
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3781524 and use the "Export to BibTeX" function there.
It is also strongly recommended to cite the
`GMT6 paper <https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GC008515>`__ (which PyGMT wraps around).
Note that some modules like ``surface`` and ``x2sys`` also have their dedicated citation.
