Generate the API reference
==========================

This page is not included in the documentation. It's used to generate the stub
pages for the modules below. The stubs are then included in api/index.rst so
that the entire reference is in a single page instead of in separate pages.

To include a new package/module, list it below and include it in api.index.rst

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ./

   gmt
   gmt.datasets
   gmt.exceptions
   gmt.clib
   gmt.helpers
