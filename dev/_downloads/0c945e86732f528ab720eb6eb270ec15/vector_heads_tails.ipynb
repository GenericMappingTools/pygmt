        "\n# Vector heads and tails\n\nMany methods in PyGMT allow plotting vectors with individual\nheads and tails. For this purpose, several modifiers may be appended to\nthe corresponding vector-producing parameters for specifying the placement\nof vector heads and tails, their shapes, and the justification of the vector.\n\nTo place a vector head at the beginning of the vector path\nsimply append **+b** to the vector-producing option (use **+e** to place\none at the end). Optionally, append **t** for a terminal line, **c** for a\ncircle, **a** for arrow (default), **i** for tail, **A** for plain open\narrow, and **I** for plain open tail. Further append **l** or **r** (e.g.\n``\"+bar\"``) to only draw the left or right half-sides of the selected head/tail\n(default is both sides) or use **+l** or **+r** to apply simultaneously to both\nbeginning and end. In this context, left and right refer to the side of the\nvector line when viewed from the beginning point to the end point of a line\nsegment. The angle of the vector head apex can be set using **+a**\\ *angle*\n(default is 30). The shape of the vector head can be adjusted using\n**+h**\\ *shape* (e.g. ``\"+h0.5\"``).\n\nFor further modifiers see :gmt-docs:`plot.html#vector-attributes`.\n\nIn the following, we use the :meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot` method to plot vectors\nwith individual heads and tails. We must specify the modifiers (together with\nthe vector type, here ``\"v\"`` for Cartesian vector, see also the\n:doc:`Vector types example </gallery/lines/vector_styles>`)\nby passing the corresponding shortcuts to the ``style`` parameter.\n"
