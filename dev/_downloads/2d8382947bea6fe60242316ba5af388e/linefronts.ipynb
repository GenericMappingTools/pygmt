        "\n# Line fronts\n\nUsing the :meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot` method you can draw a so-called\n*front* which allows to plot specific symbols distributed along a line\nor curve. Typical use cases are weather fronts, fault lines,\nsubduction zones, and more. To draw general symbols along a line or\ncurve, i.e., a so-called *decorated line*, see the\n:doc:`Decorated lines example </gallery/lines/decorated_lines>`.\n\nA front can be drawn by passing **f**\\[\u00b1]\\ *gap*\\[/*size*] to the ``style``\nparameter where *gap* defines the distance gap between the symbols and\n*size* the symbol size. If *gap* is negative, it is interpreted to mean\nthe number of symbols along the front instead. If *gap* has a leading +\nthen we use the value exactly as given [Default will start and end each\nline with a symbol, hence the *gap* is adjusted to fit]. If *size* is\nmissing it is set to 30% of the *gap*, except when *gap* is negative\nand *size* is thus required. Append **+l** or **+r** to plot symbols on\nthe left or right side of the front [Default is centered]. Append\n**+**\\ *type* to specify which symbol to plot: **b**\\ ox, **c**\\ ircle,\n**f**\\ ault [Default], **s**\\ lip, or **t**\\ riangle. Slip means left-lateral\nor right-lateral strike-slip arrows (centered is not an option). The **+s**\nmodifier optionally accepts the angle used to draw the vector [Default is\n20 degrees]. Alternatively, use **+S** which draws arcuate arrow heads.\nAppend **+o**\\ *offset* to offset the first symbol from the beginning of\nthe front by that amount [Default is 0]. The chosen symbol is drawn with\nthe same pen as set for the line (i.e., via the ``pen`` parameter). To use\nan alternate pen, append **+p**\\ *pen*. To skip the outline, just use\n**+p** with no argument. To make the main front line invisible, add **+i**.\nFor modifying the main front line via the ``pen`` parameter, see the\n:doc:`Line styles example </gallery/lines/linestyles>`.\n"
