        "\n# Lambert conic conformal projection\n\nThis conic projection was designed by the Alsatian mathematician Johann\nHeinrich Lambert (1772) and has been used extensively for mapping of regions\nwith predominantly east-west orientation, just like the Albers projection.\nUnlike the Albers projection, Lambert's conformal projection is not equal-area.\nThe parallels are arcs of circles with a common origin, and meridians are the\nequally spaced radii of these circles. As with Albers projection, it is only\nthe two standard parallels that are distortion-free.\n\n**l**\\ *lon0/lat0*\\ /\\ *lat1/lat2*\\ */scale*\nor **L**\\ *lon0/lat0*\\ /\\ *lat1/lat2*\\ */width*\n\nThe projection is set with **l** or **L**. The projection center is set by\n*lon0/lat0* and two standard parallels for the map are set with *lat1/lat2*.\nThe figure size is set with *scale* or *width*.\n"
