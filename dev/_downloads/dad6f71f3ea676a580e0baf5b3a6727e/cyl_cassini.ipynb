        "\n# Cassini Cylindrical\n\nThis cylindrical projection was developed in 1745 by C\u00e9sar-Fran\u00e7ois Cassini de\nThury for the survey of France. It is occasionally called Cassini-Soldner since\nthe latter provided the more accurate mathematical analysis that led to the\ndevelopment of the ellipsoidal formulae. The projection is neither conformal\nnor equal-area, and behaves as a compromise between the two end-members. The\ndistortion is zero along the central meridian. It is best suited for mapping\nregions of north-south extent. The central meridian, each meridian 90\u00b0 away,\nand equator are straight lines; all other meridians and parallels are complex\ncurves.\n\n**c**\\ *lon0/lat0*\\ */scale* or **C**\\ *lon0/lat0*\\ */width*\n\nThe projection is set with **c** or **C**. The projection center is set by\n*lon0/lat0*, and the figure size is set with *scale* or *width*.\n"
