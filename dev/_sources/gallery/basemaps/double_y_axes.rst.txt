Double Y-axes graph
===================

The ``frame`` parameter of the plotting methods of the :class:`pygmt.Figure`
class can control which axes should be plotted and optionally show annotations,
tick marks, and gridlines. By default, all 4 axes are plotted, along with
annotations and tick marks (denoted **W**, **S**, **E**, **N**). Lowercase
versions (**w**, **s**, **e**, **n**) can be used to denote to only plot the
axes with tick marks. We can also only plot the axes without annotations and
tick marks using **l** (left axis), **r** (right axis), **t** (top axis),
**b** (bottom axis). When ``frame`` is used to change the frame settings, any
axes that are not defined using one of these three options are not drawn.

To plot a double Y-axes graph using PyGMT, we need to plot at least two base
maps separately. The base maps should share the same projection parameter and
x-axis limits, but different y-axis limits.
