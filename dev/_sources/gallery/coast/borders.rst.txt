Political Boundaries
--------------------

The ``borders`` argument of :meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast` specifies levels of political
boundaries to plot and the pen used to draw them. Choose from the list of boundaries
below:

* 1 = National boundaries
* 2 = State boundaries within the Americas
* 3 = Marine boundaries
* a = All boundaries (1-3)

For example, to draw national boundaries with 1p thickness black lines use
``borders="1/1p,black"``. You can draw multiple boundaries by passing in a list to
``borders``.
