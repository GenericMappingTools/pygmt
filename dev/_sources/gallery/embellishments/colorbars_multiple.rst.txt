Multiple colormaps
==================

This gallery example shows how to create multiple colormaps for different subplots. To
better understand how GMT modern mode maintains several levels of colormaps, please
refer to :gmt-docs:`reference/features.html#gmt-modern-mode-hierarchical-levels` for
details.
