Inset map showing a rectangular region
--------------------------------------

The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.inset` method adds an inset figure inside a larger
figure. The function is called using a ``with`` statement, and its
``position``, ``box``, ``offset``, and ``margin`` can be customized. Plotting
methods called within the ``with`` statement plot into the inset figure.
