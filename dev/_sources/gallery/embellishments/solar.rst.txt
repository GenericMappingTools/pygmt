Day-night terminator and twilights
==================================

Use :meth:`pygmt.Figure.solar` to show the different transition stages between daytime
and nighttime. The parameter ``terminator`` is used to set the twilight stage, and can
be either ``"day_night"`` (brightest), ``"civil"``, ``"nautical"``, or
``"astronomical"`` (darkest). Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight for more
information.
