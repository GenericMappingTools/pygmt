Text formatting
===============

There are various options for formatting text contained in a plot, e.g., text added via
:meth:`pygmt.Figure.text`, the plot title, labels of colorbars as well as Cartesian
axes, and legend entries. It's also possible to change the font as well as its color
and size only for specific characters of a longer text. The supported fonts are listed
at :doc:`Supported Fonts </techref/fonts>`. For an complete overview see
:doc:`Text Formatting </techref/text_formatting>`.
