Scatter plot with histograms
============================

To create a scatter plot with histograms at the sides of the plot one can use
:meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot` in combination with :meth:`pygmt.Figure.histogram`. The
positions of the histograms are plotted by offsetting them from the main scatter plot
using :meth:`pygmt.Figure.shift_origin`.
