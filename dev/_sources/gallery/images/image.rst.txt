Images on figures
=================

The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.image` method can be used to read and place an image
file in many formats (e.g., png, jpg, eps, pdf) on a figure. We must specify
the filename via the ``imagefile`` parameter or simply use the filename as
the first argument. You can also use a full URL pointing to your desired image.
The ``position`` parameter allows us to set a reference point on the map for
the image.
