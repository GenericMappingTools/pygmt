Line styles
===========

The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot` method can plot lines in different styles.
The default line style is a 0.25-point wide, black, solid line, and can be
customized with the ``pen`` parameter.

A *pen* in GMT has three attributes: *width*, *color*, and *style*.
The *style* attribute controls the appearance of the line.
Giving ``"dotted"`` or ``"."`` yields a dotted line, whereas a dashed pen is
requested with ``"dashed"`` or ``"-"``. Also combinations of dots and dashes,
like ``".-"`` for a dot-dashed line, are allowed.

For more advanced *pen* attributes, see the GMT Technical Reference
:gmt-docs:`reference/features.html#wpen-attrib`.
