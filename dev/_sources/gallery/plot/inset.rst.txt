Inset
-----

The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.inset` method adds an inset figure inside a larger
figure. The function is called using a ``with`` statement, and its position,
box, offset, and margin parameters are set. Within the ``with`` statement,
PyGMT plotting functions can be called that add to the inset figure.
