Custom symbols
--------------

The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot` method can plot individual custom symbols
by passing the corresponding symbol name together with the **k** shortcut to
the ``style`` parameter. In total 41 custom symbols are already included of
which the following plot shows five exemplary ones. The symbols are shown
underneath their corresponding names. For the remaining symbols see the GMT
cookbook :gmt-docs:`cookbook/custom-symbols.html`.
