Custom symbols
==============

The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot` method can plot individual custom symbols by
passing the corresponding symbol name together with the **k** shortcut to the
``style`` parameter.

In total 41 custom symbols are already included of which the following plot shows
five exemplary ones. The symbols are shown underneath their corresponding names.
For the remaining symbols see the GMT Technical Reference
:gmt-docs:`reference/custom-symbols.html`.

Besides these built-in custom symbols, GMT allows users to define their own custom
symbols. For this, a specific macro language is used. A detailed introduction can
be found at :gmt-docs:`reference/custom-symbols.html#the-macro-language`. After
defining such a symbol it can be used in the same way as a built-in custom symbol.

*Please note*: Custom symbols cannot be used in auto-legends yet.
