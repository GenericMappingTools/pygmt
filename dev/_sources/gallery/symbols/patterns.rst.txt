Bit and hachure patterns
========================

In addition to colors, PyGMT also allows using bit and hachure patterns to fill symbols,
polygons, and other areas, via the ``fill`` parameter or similar parameters.

Example method parameters that support bit and hachure patterns include:

- :meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast`: Land and water masses via ``land`` and ``water``
- :meth:`pygmt.Figure.histogram`: Histogram bars via ``fill``
- :meth:`pygmt.Figure.meca`: Focal mechanisms via ``compression_fill`` and
  ``extension_fill``
- :meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot`: Symbols and polygons via ``fill``
- :meth:`pygmt.Figure.rose`: Histogram sectors via ``fill``
- :meth:`pygmt.Figure.solar`: Day-light terminators via ``fill``
- :meth:`pygmt.Figure.ternary`: Symbols via ``fill``
- :meth:`pygmt.Figure.velo`: Uncertainty wedges and velocity error ellipses via
  ``uncertainty_fill``
- :meth:`pygmt.Figure.wiggle`: Anomalies via ``positive_fill`` and ``negative_fill``

GMT provides 90 predefined 1-bit patterns, which are numbered from 1 to 90. In addition,
custom 1-, 8-, or 24-bit image raster files can also be used as patterns.

These patterns can be specified via the :class:`pygmt.params.Pattern` class. The
patterns can be customized with different resolution and different foreground and
background colors. The foreground and background colors can also be inverted.
