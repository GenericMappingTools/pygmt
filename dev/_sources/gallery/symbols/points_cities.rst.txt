GeoPandas: Plotting points with Point or MultiPoint geometry
============================================================

The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot` method allows us to plot geographical data such as points
with Point or MultiPoint geometry types stored in a :class:`geopandas.GeoDataFrame`
object. Use :func:`geopandas.read_file` to load data from any supported OGR format such
as a shapefile (.shp), GeoJSON (.geojson), geopackage (.gpkg), etc. Then, pass the
:class:`geopandas.GeoDataFrame` object as an argument to the ``data`` parameter of
:meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot`, and style the points using the ``fill`` and ``pen``
parameters. Additionally, pass suitable columns of the :class:`geopandas.GeoDataFrame`
to the ``x``,  ``y``, and ``text`` parameters of the :meth:`pygmt.Figure.text` method
to label specific features.
