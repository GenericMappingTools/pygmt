Text symbols
============

The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot` method allows to plot text symbols. Text is normally
placed with the :meth:`pygmt.Figure.text` method but there are times we wish to treat a
character or even a string as a plottable symbol. A text symbol can be drawn by passing
**l**\ *size*\ **+t**\ *string* to the ``style`` parameter where *size* defines the size
of the text symbol (note: the size is only approximate; no individual scaling is done
for different characters) and *string* can be a letter or a text string (less than 256
characters). Optionally, you can append **+f**\ *font,outlinecolor* to select a
particular font [Default is :gmt-term:`FONT_ANNOT_PRIMARY`] and outline color [Default
is black] as well as **+j**\ *justify* to change the justification [Default is CM]. For
all supported fonts see :doc:`/techref/fonts`. The fill color of the text symbols can be
set with the ``fill`` parameter, and the outline width can be customized with the
``pen`` parameter.
