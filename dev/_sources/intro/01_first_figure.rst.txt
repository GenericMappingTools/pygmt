1. Making your first figure
===========================

This tutorial covers the basics of creating a figure using PyGMT - a
Python wrapper for the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT). It will only use
the :meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast` method for plotting. Later tutorials will
address other PyGMT methods.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 12-17

Loading the library
-------------------

The first step is to import :mod:`pygmt`. All methods and figure generation
are accessible from the :mod:`pygmt` top level package.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 17-20

.. code-block:: Python


    import pygmt








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 21-26

Creating a figure
-----------------

All figure generation in PyGMT is handled by the :class:`pygmt.Figure` class.
Start a new figure by creating an instance of this class:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 26-29

.. code-block:: Python


    fig = pygmt.Figure()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 30-51

To add elements to the figure instance or object (``fig`` in this example)
different methods can be called on it. This example will use the
:meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast` method, which can be used to create a map without
any other methods or external data. The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast`
method plots the coastlines, borders, and bodies of water using a database
that is included in GMT.

First, a region for the figure must be selected. This example will plot some
of the coast of Maine in the northeastern US. A Python list can be passed to
the ``region`` parameter with the minimum and maximum X-values (longitude)
and the minimum and maximum Y-values (latitude). For this example, the
minimum (bottom left) coordinates are (N43.75, W69) and the maximum (top
right) coordinates are (N44.75, W68). Negative values can be passed for
latitudes in the southern hemisphere or longitudes in the western hemisphere.

In addition to the region, an argument needs to be passed to
:meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast` to tell it what to plot. In this example,
:meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast` will be told to plot the shorelines by passing the
Boolean value ``True`` to the ``shorelines`` parameter. The ``shorelines``
parameter has other options for finer control, but setting it to ``True``
uses the default values.

    fig.coast(region=[-69, -68, 43.75, 44.75], shorelines=True)

To see the figure, call :meth:`pygmt.Figure.show`.

Color the land and water
------------------------

This figure plots all of the coastlines in the given region, but it does not
indicate where the land and water are. Color values can be passed to ``land``
and ``water`` to set the colors on the figure.

When plotting colors in PyGMT, there are multiple
:gmt-docs:`color codes <gmtcolors.html>`, that can be used. This includes
standard GMT color names (like ``"skyblue"``), R/G/B levels (like
``"0/0/255"``), a hex value (like ``"#333333"``), or a gray level (like
``"gray50"``). For this example, GMT color names are used.

    fig.coast(
        region=[-69, -68, 43.75, 44.75],

        land="lightgreen",
        water="lightblue",
    )

Set the projection
------------------

This figure now has its colors set. By default the projection and size
of the map is set to ``"Q15c+du"``. Here, ``"Q"`` defines a
cylindrical equidistant map projection, ``"15c+du"`` means setting
the maximum (upper) map dimension to 15 cm. However, both of
these values can be customized according to the requirements using
the ``projection`` parameter.

The appropriate projection varies for the type of map. The available
projections are explained in the :doc:`projection </projections/index>`
gallery. For this example, the Mercator projection is set using ``"M"``.
The width of the figure will be 10 centimeters, as set by ``"10c"``.
The map size can also be set in inches using "i" (e.g. a 5-inch wide
Mercator projection would use ``"M5i"``).

.. code-block:: Python


    fig = pygmt.Figure()
    fig.coast(
        region=[-69, -68, 43.75, 44.75],

Add a frame
-----------

While the map's colors, projection, and size have been set, the region
that is being displayed is not apparent. A frame can be added to
annotate the latitude and longitude of the region.

The ``frame`` parameter is used to add a frame to the figure. For now, it
will be set to ``"a"`` to **a**\ nnotate the axes automatically.

.. code-block:: Python


    fig = pygmt.Figure()
    fig.coast(
        region=[-69, -68, 43.75, 44.75],
        shorelines=True,
        land="lightgreen",
        water="lightblue",
        projection="M10c",
        frame="a",
    )

   :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 137-147

Add a title
-----------

The ``frame`` parameter can be used to add a title to the figure. The title
is set by passing ``"+t"`` followed by the title (e.g. setting the map
title to "Title" would be ``"+tTitle"``).

To pass multiple arguments to ``frame``, a list can be used, as shown in the
example below. This format uses ``frame`` to set both the axes annotations
and the figure title.

Additional exercises
--------------------

This is the end of the first tutorial. Here are some additional exercises
for the concepts that were discussed:

1. Make a map of Germany using its ISO country code ("DE"). Pass the ISO
   code as a Python string to the ``region`` parameter.

2. Change the color of the landmass to "khaki" and the water to "azure".

3. Change the color of the lakes (using the ``lakes`` parameter) to "red".

4. Create a global map. Set the region to "d" to center the map at the Prime
   Meridian or "g" to center the map at the International Date Line. When the
   region is set without using a list full of integers or floating numbers,
   the argument needs to be passed as a Python string. Create a map with a
   width of 15 centimeters using the Mollweide ("W") projection.
