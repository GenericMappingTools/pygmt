Azimuthal equidistant projection
================================

The main advantage of this projection is that distances from the projection
center are displayed in correct proportions. Also directions measured from the
projection center are correct. It is very useful for a global view on locations
that lie within a certain distance or for comparing distances of different
locations relative to the projection center.

**e**\ *lon0/lat0*\ [*/horizon*]\ */scale* or
**E**\ *lon0/lat0*\ [*/horizon*]\ */width*

The projection type is set with **e** or **E**. *lon0/lat0* specifies the
projection center, and the optional parameter *horizon* specifies the maximum
distance to the projection center (i.e. the visible portion of the rest of the
world map) in degrees <= 180° (default 180°). The size of the figure is set by
*scale* or *width*.

    coast [WARNING]: Fill/clip continent option (-G) may not work for this projection.
    coast [WARNING]: If the antipode (0/4.68889e-310) is in the ocean then chances are good it will work.
    coast [WARNING]: Otherwise, avoid projection center coordinates that are exact multiples of 80 degrees.
