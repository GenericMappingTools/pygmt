Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection
=======================================

This projection was developed by Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1772 and is
typically used for mapping large regions like continents and hemispheres. It is
an azimuthal, equal-area projection, but is not perspective. Distortion is zero
at the center of the projection, and increases radially away from this point.

**a**\ *lon0/lat0*\ [*/horizon*\ ]\ */scale*
or **A**\ *lon0/lat0*\ [*/horizon*\ ]\ */width*

**a** or **A** specifies the projection type, and *lon0/lat0* specifies the
projection center, *horizon* specifies the maximum distance from projection
center (in degrees, <= 180, default 90), and *scale* or *width* sets the size
of the figure.
