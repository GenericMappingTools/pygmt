Orthographic projection
=======================

This is a perspective projection like the general perspective, but with the
difference that the point of perspective lies in infinite distance.
It is therefore often used to give the appearance of a globe viewed from outer
space, were one hemisphere can be seen as a whole. It is neither conformal nor
equal-area and the distortion increases near the edges.

**g**\ *lon0/lat0*\ [*/horizon*\ ]\ */scale*
or **G**\ *lon0/lat0*\ [*/horizon*\ ]\ */width*

**g** or **G** specifies the projection type, *lon0/lat0* specifies the
projection center, the optional parameter *horizon* specifies the maximum
distance from projection center (in degrees, <= 90, default 90), and *scale*
and *width* set the figure size.
