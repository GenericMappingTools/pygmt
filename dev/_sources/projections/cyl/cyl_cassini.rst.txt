Cassini cylindrical projection
==============================

This cylindrical projection was developed in 1745 by César-François Cassini de
Thury for the survey of France. It is occasionally called Cassini-Soldner since
the latter provided the more accurate mathematical analysis that led to the
development of the ellipsoidal formulae. The projection is neither conformal
nor equal-area, and behaves as a compromise between the two end-members. The
distortion is zero along the central meridian. It is best suited for mapping
regions of north-south extent. The central meridian, each meridian 90° away,
and equator are straight lines; all other meridians and parallels are complex
curves.

**c**\ *lon0/lat0*\ */scale* or **C**\ *lon0/lat0*\ */width*

The projection is set with **c** or **C**. The projection center is set by
*lon0/lat0*, and the figure size is set with *scale* or *width*.
