Cylindrical equal-area projection
=================================

This cylindrical projection is actually several projections, depending on what
latitude is selected as the standard parallel. However, they are all equal area
and hence non-conformal. All meridians and parallels are straight lines.

**y**\ *lon0/lat0*\ */scale* or **Y**\ *lon0/lat0*\ */width*

The projection is set with **y** or **Y**. The projection center is set by
*lon0/lat0*, and the figure size is set with *scale* or *width*.
