Cylindrical Stereographic
=========================

The cylindrical stereographic projections are certainly not as notable as other
cylindrical projections, but are still used because of their relative simplicity and
their ability to overcome some of the downsides of other cylindrical projections, like
extreme distortions of the higher latitudes. The stereographic projections are
perspective projections, projecting the sphere onto a cylinder in the direction of the
antipodal point on the equator. The cylinder crosses the sphere at two standard
parallels, equidistant from the equator.

**cyl_stere/**\ [*lon0/*]\ [*lat0/*]\ *scale*
or **Cyl_stere/**\ [*lon0/*]\ [*lat0/*]\ *width*

The projection is set with **cyl_stere** or **Cyl_stere**. The central meridian is set
by the optional *lon0*, and the figure size is set with *scale* or *width*.

The standard parallel is typically one of these (but can be any value):

* 66.159467 - Miller's modified Gall
* 55 - Kamenetskiy's First
* 45 - Gall's Stereographic
* 30 - Bolshoi Sovietskii Atlas Mira or Kamenetskiy's Second
* 0 - Braun's Cylindrical
