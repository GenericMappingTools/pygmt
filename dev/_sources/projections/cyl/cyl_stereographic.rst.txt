Cylindrical Stereographic
=========================

The cylindrical stereographic projections are certainly not as notable as other
cylindrical projections, but are still used because of their relative
simplicity and their ability to overcome some of the downsides of other
cylindrical projections, like extreme distortions of the higher latitudes. The
stereographic projections are perspective projections, projecting the sphere
onto a cylinder in the direction of the antipodal point on the equator. The
cylinder crosses the sphere at two standard parallels, equidistant from the
equator.

**cyl_stere/**\ [*lon0/*]\ [*lat0/*]\ *scale*
or **Cyl_stere/**\ [*lon0/*]\ [*lat0/*]\ *width*

The projection is set with **cyl_stere** or **Cyl_stere**. The central meridian
is set by the optional *lon0*, and the figure size is set with *scale* or
*width*.

The standard parallel is typically one of these (but can be any value):

* 66.159467 - Miller's modified Gall
* 55 - Kamenetskiy's First
* 45 - Gall's Stereographic
* 30 - Bolshoi Sovietskii Atlas Mira or Kamenetskiy's Second
* 0 - Braun's Cylindrical
