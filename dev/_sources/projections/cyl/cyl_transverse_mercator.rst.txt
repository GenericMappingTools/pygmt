Transverse Mercator projection
==============================

The transverse Mercator was invented by Johann Heinrich Lambert in 1772. In
this projection the cylinder touches a meridian along which there is no
distortion. The distortion increases away from the central meridian and goes to
infinity at 90° from center. The central meridian, each meridian 90° away from
the center, and equator are straight lines; other parallels and meridians are
complex curves.

**t**\ *lon0*\ [/\ *lat0*]/\ *scale* or **T**\ *lon0*\ [/\ *lat0*]/\ *width*

The projection is set with **t** or **T**. The central meridian is set
by  *lon0*, the latitude of the origin is set by the optional *lat0*, and the
figure size is set with *scale* or *width*.
