Robinson projection
===================

The Robinson projection, presented by the American geographer and cartographer
Arthur H. Robinson in 1963, is a modified cylindrical projection that is
neither conformal nor equal-area. Central meridian and all parallels are
straight lines; other meridians are curved. It uses lookup tables rather than
analytic expressions to make the world map "look" right [#f1]_.
The scale is true along latitudes 38° north and south. The projection was
originally developed for use by Rand McNally and is currently used by the
National Geographic Society.

**n**\ [*lon0/*]\ *scale* or **N**\ [*lon0/*]\ *width*

The projection is set with **n** or **N**. The central meridian is set with the
optional *lon0*, and the figure size is set with *scale* or *width*.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] Robinson provided a table of y-coordinates for latitudes every 5°.
         To project values for intermediate latitudes one must interpolate
         the table. Different interpolants may result in slightly different
         maps. GMT uses the interpolant selected by the parameter
         :gmt-term:`GMT_INTERPOLANT` in the gmt.conf file.
