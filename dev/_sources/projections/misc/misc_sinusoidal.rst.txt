Sinusoidal
==========

The sinusoidal projection is one of the oldest known projections, is
equal-area, and has been used since the mid-16th century. It has also been
called the "Equal-area Mercator" projection. The central meridian is a straight
line; all other meridians are sinusoidal curves. Parallels are all equally
spaced straight lines, with scale being true along all parallels (and central
meridian).

**i**\ [*lon0/*]\ *scale* or **I**\ [*lon0/*]\ *width*

The projection is set with **i** or **I**. The central meridian is set with the
optional *lon0*, and the figure size is set with *scale* or *width*.
