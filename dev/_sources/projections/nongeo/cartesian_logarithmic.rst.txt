Cartesian logarithmic
=====================

**X**\ *width*\ [**l**][/*height*\ [**l**]] or
**x**\ *x-scale*\ [**l**][/*y-scale*\ [**l**]]

Give the *width* of the plot and the optional *height*. The lowercase version **x** is
similar to **X** but expects an *x-scale* and an optional *y-scale*. Each axis with a
logarithmic transformation requires an **l** after its size argument.
