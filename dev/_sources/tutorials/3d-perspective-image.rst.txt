Creating a 3D perspective image
===============================

Create 3-D perspective image or surface mesh from a grid
using :meth:`pygmt.Figure.grdview`.

.. note::

    This tutorial assumes the use of a Python notebook, such as IPython or Jupyter Notebook.
    To see the figures while using a Python script instead, use
    ``fig.show(method="external)`` to display the figure in the default PDF viewer.

    To save the figure, use ``fig.savefig("figname.pdf")`` where ``"figname.pdf"``
    is the desired name and file extension for the saved figure.

The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.grdview` method takes the ``grid`` input.
The ``perspective`` argument changes the azimuth and elevation of the viewpoint; the
default is [180, 90], which is looking directly down on the figure and north is "up".
The ``zsize`` argument sets how tall the three-dimensional portion appears.

The default grid surface type is *mesh plot*.

The grid surface type can be set with the ``surftype`` parameter.
The default CPT is *turbo* and can be customized with the ``cmap`` parameter.

The ``plane`` argument sets the elevation and color of a plane that provides a fill
below the surface relief.

The ``perspective`` azimuth can be changed to set the direction that is "up"
in the figure. The ``contourpen`` parameter sets the pen used to draw contour lines
on the surface. :meth:`pygmt.Figure.colorbar` can be used to add a color bar to the
figure. The ``cmap`` parameter does not need to be passed again. To keep the color
bar's alignment similar to the figure, use ``True`` as the ``perspective`` parameter.
