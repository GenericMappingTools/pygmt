Adding an inset to the figure
=============================

To plot an inset figure inside another larger figure, we can use the
:meth:`pygmt.Figure.inset` method. After a large figure has been created, call ``inset``
using a ``with`` statement, and new plot elements will be added to the inset figure
instead of the larger figure.

Prior to creating an inset figure, a larger figure must first be plotted. In the
example below, :meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast` is used to create a map of the US state of
Massachusetts.

    fig = pygmt.Figure()
    fig.coast(
        region=[-74, -69.5, 41, 43],  # Set bounding box of the large figure
        borders="2/thin",  # Plot state boundaries with thin lines
        shorelines="thin",  # Plot coastline with thin lines
        projection="M15c",  # Set Mercator projection and size of 15 centimeter
        land="lightyellow",  # Color land areas light yellow
        water="lightblue",  # Color water areas light blue
        frame="a",  # Set frame with annotation and major tick spacing
    )
    fig.show()

The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.inset` method uses a context manager, and is called using a
``with`` statement. The ``position`` parameter, including the inset width, is required
to plot the inset. In the example below, the inset is placed at the Bottom Left
(``BL``) inside the plot. The ``box`` parameter can set the fill and border of the
inset.

    fig.coast(
        region=[-74, -69.5, 41, 43],

        land="lightyellow",
        water="lightblue",
        frame="a",
    )
    with fig.inset(position=Position("BL"), width=3, box=Box(pen="black", fill="lightred")):
        # pass is used to exit the with statement as no plotting methods are called
        pass
    fig.show()

When placed at the Bottom Left corner inside the plot, the default location is in
contact with the nearby axis or axes. The offsets along the x- and y-axes can be set
with the ``offset`` parameter of the ``Position`` class. If only one offset is passed,
it is applied to both axes. Each offset can have its own unit. In the example below,
the inset is shifted 0.5 centimeters on the x-axis and 0.2 centimeters on the y-axis.

Standard plotting methods can be called from within the ``inset`` context manager. The
example below uses :meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast` to plot a zoomed out map that
selectively paints the state of Massachusetts to show its location relative to other
states.

    # width/height are determined by the ``region`` and ``projection`` parameters.
