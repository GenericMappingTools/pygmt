Making subplots
===============

When you're preparing a figure for a paper, there will often be times when you'll need
to put many individual plots into one large figure, and tag them 'abcd'. These
individual plots are called subplots.

There are two main ways to create subplots in GMT:

- Use :meth:`pygmt.Figure.shift_origin` to manually move each individual plot to the
  right position.
- Use :meth:`pygmt.Figure.subplot` to define the layout of the subplots.

The first method is easier to use and should handle simple cases involving a couple of
subplots. For more advanced subplot layouts, however, we recommend the use of
:meth:`pygmt.Figure.subplot` which offers finer grained control, and this is what the
tutorial below will cover.

.. code-block:: Python

    import pygmt








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 25-26

Let's start by initializing a :class:`pygmt.Figure` instance.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 26-30

.. code-block:: Python


    fig = pygmt.Figure()

Define subplot layout
---------------------

The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.subplot` method is used to set up the layout, size, and other
attributes of the figure. It divides the whole canvas into regular grid areas with
*n* rows and *m* columns. Each grid area can contain an individual subplot. For
example:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-44

.. code-block:: default

    with fig.subplot(nrows=2, ncols=3, figsize=("15c", "6c"), frame="lrtb"):
        ...

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 46-51

will define our figure to have a 2 row and 3 column grid layout.
``figsize=("15c", "6c")`` defines the overall size of the figure to be 15 cm wide by
6 cm high. Using ``frame="lrtb"`` allows us to customize the map frame for all
subplots instead of setting them individually. The figure layout will look like the
following:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 51-64

.. code-block:: Python


    with fig.subplot(nrows=2, ncols=3, figsize=("15c", "6c"), frame="lrtb"):
        for i in range(2):  # row number starting from 0
            for j in range(3):  # column number starting from 0
                index = i * 3 + j  # index number starting from 0
                with fig.set_panel(panel=index):  # sets the current panel
                    fig.text(
                        position="MC",
                        text=f"index: {index}; row: {i}, col: {j}",
                        region=[0, 1, 0, 1],
                    )
    fig.show()

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 65-70

The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.set_panel` method activates a specified subplot, and all
subsequent plotting methods will take place in that subplot panel. This is similar to
matplotlib's ``plt.sca`` method. In order to specify a subplot, you will need to
provide the identifier for that subplot via the ``panel`` parameter. Pass in either
the *index* number, or a tuple/list like (*row*, *col*) to ``panel``.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 72-77

.. note::

    The row and column numbering starts from 0. So for a subplot layout with N rows
    and M columns, row numbers will go from 0 to N-1, and column numbers will go from
    0 to M-1.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 79-82

For example, to activate the subplot on the top right corner (index: 2) at *row*\=0
and *col*\=2, so that all subsequent plotting commands happen there, you can use the
following command:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 84-88

.. code-block:: default

    with fig.set_panel(panel=(0, 2)):
        ...

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 91-96

Making your first subplot
-------------------------

Next, let's use what we learned above to make a 2 row by 2 column subplot figure.
We'll also pick up on some new parameters to configure our subplot.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 96-113

.. code-block:: Python


    fig = pygmt.Figure()
    with fig.subplot(
        nrows=2,
        ncols=2,
        figsize=("15c", "6c"),
        tag=True,
        frame=["af", "WSne"],
        margins=["0.1c", "0.2c"],
        title="My Subplot Heading",
    ):
        fig.basemap(region=[0, 10, 0, 10], projection="X?", panel=[0, 0])
        fig.basemap(region=[0, 20, 0, 10], projection="X?", panel=[0, 1])
        fig.basemap(region=[0, 10, 0, 20], projection="X?", panel=[1, 0])
        fig.basemap(region=[0, 20, 0, 20], projection="X?", panel=[1, 1])
    fig.show()

   :alt: subplots
   :srcset: /tutorials/advanced/images/sphx_glr_subplots_002.png
   :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 114-128

In this example, we define a 2-row, 2-column (2x2) subplot layout using
:meth:`pygmt.Figure.subplot`. The overall figure dimensions is set to be 15 cm wide
and 6 cm high (``figsize=("15c", "6c")``). In addition, we use some optional
parameters to fine-tune some details of the figure creation:

- ``tag=True``: Each subplot is automatically tagged 'abcd'.
- ``margins=["0.1c", "0.2c"]``: Adjusts the space between adjacent subplots. In this
  case, it is set as 0.1 cm in the x-direction and 0.2 cm in the y-direction.
- ``title="My Subplot Heading"``: Adds a title on top of the whole figure.

Notice that each subplot was set to use a linear projection ``"X?"``. Usually, we need
to specify the width and height of the map frame, but it is also possible to use a
question mark ``"?"`` to let GMT decide automatically on what is the most appropriate
width/height for each subplot's map frame.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 130-142

.. tip::

    In the above example, we used the following commands to activate the four subplots
    explicitly one after another::

        fig.basemap(..., panel=[0, 0])
        fig.basemap(..., panel=[0, 1])
        fig.basemap(..., panel=[1, 0])
        fig.basemap(..., panel=[1, 1])

    In fact, we can just use ``fig.basemap(..., panel=True)`` without specifying any
    subplot index number, and GMT will automatically activate the next subplot panel.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 144-151

.. note::

    All plotting methods (e.g. :meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast`, :meth:`pygmt.Figure.text`,
    etc) are able to use ``panel`` parameter when in subplot mode. Once a panel is
    activated using ``panel`` or :meth:`pygmt.Figure.set_panel`, subsequent plotting
    commands that don't set a ``panel`` will have their elements added to the same
    panel as before.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 154-161

Shared x- and y-axes
--------------------

In the example above with the four subplots, the two subplots for each row have the
same y-axis range, and the two subplots for each column have the same x-axis range.
You can use the ``sharex``/``sharey`` parameters to set a common x- and/or y-axis
between subplots.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 161-180

.. code-block:: Python


    fig = pygmt.Figure()
    with fig.subplot(
        nrows=2,
        ncols=2,
        figsize=("15c", "6c"),  # width of 15 cm, height of 6 cm
        tag=True,
        margins=["0.3c", "0.2c"],  # horizontal 0.3 cm and vertical 0.2 cm margins
        title="My Subplot Heading",
        sharex="b",  # shared x-axis on the bottom side
        sharey="l",  # shared y-axis on the left side
        frame="WSrt",
    ):
        fig.basemap(region=[0, 10, 0, 10], projection="X?", panel=True)
        fig.basemap(region=[0, 20, 0, 10], projection="X?", panel=True)
        fig.basemap(region=[0, 10, 0, 20], projection="X?", panel=True)
        fig.basemap(region=[0, 20, 0, 20], projection="X?", panel=True)
    fig.show()

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 181-188

``sharex="b"`` indicates that subplots in a column will share the x-axis, and only the
**b**\ ottom axis is displayed. ``sharey="l"`` indicates that subplots within a row
will share the y-axis, and only the **l**\ eft axis is displayed.

Of course, instead of using the ``sharex``/``sharey`` parameters, you can also set a
different ``frame`` for each subplot to control the axis properties individually for
each subplot.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 191-199

Advanced subplot layouts
------------------------

Nested subplots are currently not supported. If you want to create more complex
subplot layouts, some manual adjustments are needed.

The following example draws three subplots in a 2-row, 2-column layout, with the first
subplot occupying the first row.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 199-220

.. code-block:: Python


    fig = pygmt.Figure()
    # Bottom row, two subplots
    with fig.subplot(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=("15c", "3c"), tag="b)"):
        fig.basemap(
            region=[0, 5, 0, 5], projection="X?", frame=["af", "WSne"], panel=[0, 0]
        )
        fig.basemap(
            region=[0, 5, 0, 5], projection="X?", frame=["af", "WSne"], panel=[0, 1]
        )
    # Move plot origin by 1 cm above the height of the entire figure
    fig.shift_origin(yshift="h+1c")
    # Top row, one subplot
    with fig.subplot(nrows=1, ncols=1, figsize=("15c", "3c"), tag="a)"):
        fig.basemap(
            region=[0, 10, 0, 10], projection="X?", frame=["af", "WSne"], panel=[0, 0]
        )
        fig.text(text="TEXT", x=5, y=5)

    fig.show()

We start by drawing the bottom two subplots, setting ``tag="b)"`` so that the subplots
are tagged 'b)' and 'c)'. Next, we use :meth:`pygmt.Figure.shift_origin` to move the
plot origin 1 cm above the **h**\ eight of the entire figure that is currently plotted
(i.e. the bottom row subplots). A single subplot is then plotted on the top row. You
may need to adjust the ``yshift`` parameter to make your plot look nice. This top row
uses ``tag="a)"``, and we also plotted some text inside. Note that ``projection="X?"``
was used to let GMT automatically determine the size of the subplot according to the
size of the subplot area.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 231-235

You can also manually override the ``tag`` for each subplot using for example,
``fig.set_panel(..., tag="b) Panel 2")`` which would allow you to manually tag a
single subplot as you wish. This can be useful for adding a more descriptive subtitle
to individual subplots.
