Making your first figure
========================

Welcome to PyGMT! Here we'll cover some of basic concepts, like creating simple figures
and naming conventions.

.. note::

    This tutorial assumes the use of a Python notebook, such as `IPython <https://ipython.org/>`__
    or `JupyterLab <https://jupyter.org/>`__.
    To see the figures while using a Python script instead, use
    ``fig.show(method="external")`` to display the figure in the default PDF viewer.

    To save the figure, use ``fig.savefig("figname.pdf")`` where ``"figname.pdf"``
    is the desired name and file extension for the saved figure.

Loading the library
-------------------

All modules and figure generation is accessible from the :mod:`pygmt` top level
package:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 25-28

.. code-block:: default


    import pygmt








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 29-34

Creating figures
----------------

All figure generation in PyGMT is handled by the :class:`pygmt.Figure` class.
Start a new figure by creating an instance of this class:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 34-37

.. code-block:: default


    fig = pygmt.Figure()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 38-43

Add elements to the figure using its methods. For example, let's use
:meth:`pygmt.Figure.basemap` to start the creation of a map. We'll use the ``region`` parameter
to provide the longitude and latitude bounds, the ``projection`` parameter to set
the projection to Mercator (**M**) and the map width to 15 cm, and the ``frame``
parameter to generate a frame with automatic tick and annotation spacings.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 43-46

.. code-block:: default


    fig.basemap(region=[-90, -70, 0, 20], projection="M15c", frame=True)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 47-49

Now we can add coastlines using :meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast` to this map using the
default resolution, line width, and color:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 49-52

.. code-block:: default


    fig.coast(shorelines=True)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 53-54

To see the figure, call :meth:`pygmt.Figure.show`:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 54-57

.. code-block:: default


    fig.show()




.. image:: /tutorials/images/sphx_glr_first_figure_001.png
    :alt: first figure
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img


.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    <IPython.core.display.Image object>



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 58-60

You can also set the map region, projection, and frame type directly in other methods
without calling :meth:`gmt.Figure.basemap`:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 60-65

.. code-block:: default


    fig = pygmt.Figure()
    fig.coast(shorelines=True, region=[-90, -70, 0, 20], projection="M15c", frame=True)
    fig.show()




.. image:: /tutorials/images/sphx_glr_first_figure_002.png
    :alt: first figure
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img


.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none


    <IPython.core.display.Image object>



.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 66-105

Saving figures
--------------

Use the method :meth:`pygmt.Figure.savefig` to save your figure to a file. The figure
format is inferred from the extension.

.. code:: python

    fig.savefig("central-america-shorelines.png")

Note for experienced GMT users
------------------------------

You have probably noticed several things that are different from classic
command-line GMT. Many of these changes reflect the new GMT modern execution
mode that is part of GMT 6.

1. As a general rule, the ``ps`` prefix has been removed from all ``ps*``
   modules (PyGMT methods). For example, the name of the GMT 5 module ``pscoast``
   is ``coast`` in GMT 6 and PyGMT. The exceptions are:  ``psxy`` which is now
   ``plot``, ``psxyz`` which is now ``plot3d``, and ``psscale`` which is now
   ``colorbar``.

2. More details can be found in the :gmt-docs:`GMT cookbook introduction to
   modern mode </cookbook/introduction.html#modern-and-classic-mode>`.

A few are PyGMT exclusive (like the ``savefig`` method).

1. The PyGMT parameters (called options or arguments in GMT) don't use the GMT
   1-letter syntax (**R**, **J**, **B**, etc). We use longer
   aliases for these parameters and have some Python exclusive names. The mapping
   between the GMT parameters and their PyGMT aliases should be straightforward.
   For some modules, these aliases are still being developed.
2. Parameters like ``region`` can take :class:`lists <list>` as well as strings like ``1/2/3/4``.
3. If a GMT option has no arguments (like ``-B`` instead of ``-Baf``), use a ``True``
   in Python. An empty string would also be acceptable. For repeated parameters, such
   as ``-B+Loleron -Bxaf -By+lm``, provide a :class:`list`: ``frame=["+Loleron", "xaf", "y+lm"]``.
4. There is no output redirecting to a PostScript file. The figure is generated in the
   background and will only be shown or saved when you ask for it.
