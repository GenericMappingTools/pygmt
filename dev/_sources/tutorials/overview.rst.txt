Making your first figure
========================

Welcome to PyGMT! Here we'll cover some of basic concepts, like creating simple figures
and naming conventions.

Loading the library
-------------------

All modules and figure generation is accessible from the :mod:`pygmt` top level
package:


.. code-block:: python


    import pygmt







Creating figures
----------------

All figure generation in PyGMT is handled by the :class:`pygmt.Figure` class.
Start a new figure by creating an instance of this class:


.. code-block:: python


    fig = pygmt.Figure()







Add elements to the figure using its methods. For example, let's start a map with an
automatic frame and ticks around a given longitude and latitude bound, set the
projection to Mercator (``M``), and the figure width to 8 inches:


.. code-block:: python


    fig.basemap(region=[-90, -70, 0, 20], projection="M8i", frame=True)







Now we can add coastlines using :meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast` to this map using the
default resolution, line width, and color:


.. code-block:: python


    fig.coast(shorelines=True)







To see the figure, call :meth:`pygmt.Figure.show`:


.. code-block:: python


    fig.show()




.. image:: /tutorials/images/sphx_glr_overview_001.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




You can also set the map region, projection, and frame type directly in other methods
without calling :meth:`gmt.Figure.basemap`:


.. code-block:: python


    fig = pygmt.Figure()
    fig.coast(shorelines=True, region=[-90, -70, 0, 20], projection="M8i", frame=True)
    fig.show()




.. image:: /tutorials/images/sphx_glr_overview_002.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




Saving figures
--------------

Use the method :meth:`pygmt.Figure.savefig` to save your figure to a file. The figure
format is inferred from the extension.

.. code:: python

    fig.savefig("central-america-shorelines.png")

Note for experienced GMT users
------------------------------

You’ll probably have noticed several things that are different from classic
command-line GMT. Many of these changes reflect the new GMT modern execution mode that
will be part of the future 6.0 release. A few are PyGMT exclusive (like the
``savefig`` method).

1. The name of method is ``coast`` instead of ``pscoast``. As a general rule, all
   ``ps*`` modules had their ``ps`` prefix removed. The exceptions are:
   ``psxy`` which is now ``plot``, ``psxyz`` which is now ``plot3d``, and ``psscale``
   which is now ``colorbar``.
2. The arguments don't use the GMT 1-letter syntax (R, J, B, etc). We use longer
   aliases for these arguments and have some Python exclusive names. The mapping
   between the GMT arguments and their Python counterparts should be straight forward.
3. Arguments like ``region`` can take lists as well as strings like ``1/2/3/4``.
4. If a GMT argument has no options (like ``-B`` instead of ``-Baf``), use a ``True``
   in Python. An empty string would also be acceptable.
5. There is no output redirecting to a PostScript file. The figure is generated in the
   background and will only be shown or saved when you ask for it.
