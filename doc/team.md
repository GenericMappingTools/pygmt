# Team Gallery

We are an international team dedicated to building a Pythonic API for the
Generic Mapping Tools (GMT). Our goal is to improve GMT's accessibility for
new and experienced users by creating user-friendly interfaces with the GMT
C API, supporting rich display in Jupyter notebooks, and integrating with
the PyData ecosystem.

All are welcome to become involved with the PyGMT project! For more information
about how to get involved, see the {doc}`contributing`.
