Justification codes
===================

To adjust the position of plot embellishments, such as scalebars, directional roses,
colorbars, legends, and images, users can pass a two-character (order-independent)
code. Choose from

- Vertical: **T**\(op), **M**\(iddle), **B**\(ottom)
- Horizontal: **L**\(eft), **C**\(entre), **R**\(ight)
