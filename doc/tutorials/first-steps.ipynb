    "A few are GMT/Python exclusive (like the long argument names).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The name of method is `coast` instead of `pscoast`. As a general rule, all `ps*` modules had their `ps` removed. The exceptions are: `psxy == plot`, `psxyz == plot3d`, and `psscale == colorbar`.\n",
    "2. The arguments don't use the GMT 1-letter syntax (R, J, B, etc). Those are still available as aliases and the methods will accept them (see below). \n",
    "3. Arguments like `region` can take lists instead of strings like `1/2/3/4`. You can still use the string form but the list form is easier in Python.\n",
    "4. If a GMT argument has no options (like `-B` instead of `-Baf`), use a `True` value instead. An empty string would also be acceptable.\n",
    "5. There is no output redirecting to a PostScript file. The figure is generated in the background and will only be shown or saved when you ask for it."
