"""
Double Y axes graph
-------------------

The ``frame`` parameter of the plotting methods of the :class:`pygmt.Figure`
class can control which axes should be plotted and optionally show annotations,
tick marks, and gridlines. By default, all 4 axes are plotted, along with annotations
and tick marks (denoted **W**, **S**, **E**, **N**). Lower case versions (**w**, **s**,
**e**, **n**) can be used to denote to only plot the axes with tick marks. We
can also only plot the axes without annotations and tick marks using **l**
(left axis), **r** (right axis), **t** (top axis), **b** (bottom axis).
When ``frame`` is used to change the frame settings, any axes
that are not defined using one of these three options are not
drawn.

To plot a double Y-axes graph using PyGMT, we need to plot at least two base maps
separately. The base maps should share the same projection parameter and
x-axis limits, but different y-axis limits.
