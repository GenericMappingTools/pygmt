Inset
-----

The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.inset` method adds an inset figure inside a larger
figure. The function is called using a ``with`` statement, and its ``position``,
``box``, ``offset``, and ``margin`` parameters are set. Plotting methods called
within the ``with`` statement are applied to the inset figure.
