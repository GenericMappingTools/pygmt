"""
Cross-section along a transect
==============================
:func:`pygmt.project` and :func:`pygmt.grdtrack` can be used to focus on
a quantity and its variation along a desired survey line.
In this example, the elevation is extracted from a grid provided via
:func:`pygmt.datasets.load_earth_relief`.
The figure consists of two parts, a map of the elevation in the study
area showing the survey line and a Cartesian plot showing the elevation
along the survey line.

*This example is orientated on an example in the GMT/China documentation*:
https://docs.gmt-china.org/latest/examples/ex026/
