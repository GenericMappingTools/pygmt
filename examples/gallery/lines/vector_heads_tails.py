Vector heads and tails
----------------------

Many modules in PyGMT allow plotting vectors with individual
heads and tails. For this purpose, several modifiers may be appended to
the corresponding vector-producing parameters for specifying the placement
of vector heads and tails, their shapes, and the justification of the vector.

To place a vector head at the beginning of the vector path
simply append **+b** to the vector-producing option (use **+e** to place
one at the end). Optionally, append **t** for a terminal line, **c** for a
circle, **a** for arrow (default), **i** for tail, **A** for plain open
arrow, and **I** for plain open tail. Further append **l** or **r** (e.g.
``+bar``) to only draw the left or right half-sides of the selected head/tail
(default is both sides) or use **+l** or **+r** to apply simultaneously to both
sides. In this context left and right refer to the side of the vector line
when viewed from the beginning point to the end point of a line segment.
The angle of the vector head apex can be set using **+a**\ *angle*
(default is 30). The shape of the vector head can be adjusted using
**+h**\ *shape* (e.g. ``+h0.5``).

For further modifiers see the *Vector Attributes* subsection of the
corresponding module.

In the following we use the :meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot` method to plot vectors
with individual heads and tails. We must specify the modifiers (together with
the vector type, here ``v``, see also
:doc:`Vector types documentation </gallery/lines/vector_styles>`)
by passing the corresponding shortcuts to the ``style`` parameter.
