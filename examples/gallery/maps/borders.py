Political Boundaries
--------------------

The ``borders`` parameter of :meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast` specifies levels of political
boundaries to plot and the pen used to draw them. Choose from the list of boundaries
below:

* **1** = National boundaries
* **2** = State boundaries within the Americas
* **3** = Marine boundaries
* **a** = All boundaries (1-3)

For example, to draw national boundaries with a line thickness of 1p and black line
color use ``borders="1/1p,black"``. You can draw multiple boundaries by passing in
a list to ``borders``.
