Intro to PyGMT
==============

Welcome to PyGMT! This tutorial is designed to teach the basic concepts to
make a map in PyGMT.

**About this tutorial**

This tutorial assumes that PyGMT has been successfully installed. A quick
way to test this is to type ``import pygmt`` in a Python IDE or Jupyter
Notebook.

This tutorial will progressively cover PyGMT plotting concepts, and later
examples will use concepts explained in previous examples. It will not
cover all PyGMT modules.
