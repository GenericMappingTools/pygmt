1. Making your first figure
===========================

This tutorial page covers the basics of creating a figure using PyGMT - a
Python wrapper for the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT). It will only use
the :meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast` method for plotting. Later examples will
address other PyGMT methods.

# Setting up the development environment
# --------------------------------------
#
# PyGMT can be used in both a Python script and a notebook environment, such
# as Jupyter. The tutorial's recommended method is to use a notebook, and the
# code will be for a notebook environment.


###############################################################################
# Loading the library
# -------------------
#
# The first step is to import :mod:`pygmt`. All methods and figure generation
# are accessible from the :mod:`pygmt` top level package.

# sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_number = 4
import pygmt

###############################################################################
# Creating a figure
# -----------------
#
# All figure generation in PyGMT is handled by the :class:`pygmt.Figure` class.
# Start a new figure by creating an instance of this class:

fig = pygmt.Figure()

###############################################################################
# To add elements to the figure instance or object (``fig`` in this example)
# different methods can be called on it. This example will use the
# :meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast` method, which can be used to create a map without
# any other methods or external data. The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast`
# method plots the coastlines, borders, and bodies of water using a database
# that is included in GMT.
#
# First, a region for the figure must be selected. This example will plot some
# of the coast of Maine in the northeastern US. A Python list can be passed to
# the ``region`` parameter with the minimum and maximum X-values (longitude)
# and the minimum and maximum Y-values (latitude). For this example, the
# minimum (bottom left) coordinates are (N43.75, W69) and the maximum (top
# right) coordinates are (N44.75, W68). Negative values can be passed for
# latitudes in the southern hemisphere or longitudes in the western hemisphere.
#
# In addition to the region, an argument needs to be passed to
# :meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast` to tell it what to plot. In this example,
# :meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast` will be told to plot the shorelines by passing the
# Boolean value ``True`` to the ``shorelines`` parameter. The ``shorelines``
# parameter has other options for finer control, but setting it to ``True``
# uses the default values.

fig.coast(region=[-69, -68, 43.75, 44.75], shorelines=True)

###############################################################################
# To see the figure, call :meth:`pygmt.Figure.show`.

fig.show()

###############################################################################
# Color the land and water
# ------------------------
#
# This figure plots all of the coastlines in the given region, but it does not
# indicate where the land and water are. Color values can be passed to ``land``
# and ``water`` to set the colors on the figure.
#
# When plotting colors in PyGMT, there are multiple
# :gmt-docs:`color codes <gmtcolors.html>`, that can be used. This includes
# standard GMT color names (like ``"skyblue"``), R/G/B levels (like
# ``"0/0/255"``), a hex value (like ``"#333333"``), or a gray level (like
# ``"gray50"``). For this example, GMT color names are used.

fig = pygmt.Figure()
fig.coast(
    region=[-69, -68, 43.75, 44.75],
    shorelines=True,
    land="lightgreen",
    water="lightblue",
)
fig.show()

###############################################################################
# Set the projection
# ------------------
#
# This figure now has its colors set. By default the projection and size
# of the map is set to ``"Q15c+du"``. Here, ``"Q"`` defines a
# cylindrical equidistant map projection, ``"15c+du"`` means setting
# the maximum (upper) map dimension to 15 cm. However, both of
# these values can be customized according to the requirements using
# the ``projection`` parameter.
#
# The appropriate projection varies for the type of map. The available
# projections are explained in the :doc:`projection </projections/index>`
# gallery. For this example, the Mercator projection is set using ``"M"``.
# The width of the figure will be 10 centimeters, as set by ``"10c"``.
# The map size can also be set in inches using "i" (e.g. a 5-inch wide
# Mercator projection would use ``"M5i"``).

fig = pygmt.Figure()
fig.coast(
    region=[-69, -68, 43.75, 44.75],
    shorelines=True,
    land="lightgreen",
    water="lightblue",
    projection="M10c",
)
fig.show()

###############################################################################
# Add a frame
# -----------
#
# While that the map's colors, projection, and size have been set, the region
# that is being displayed is not apparent. A frame can be added to
# annotate the latitude and longitude of the region.
#
# The ``frame`` parameter is used to add a frame to the figure. For now, it
# will be set to ``"a"`` to **a**\ nnotate the axes automatically.

fig = pygmt.Figure()
fig.coast(
    region=[-69, -68, 43.75, 44.75],
    shorelines=True,
    land="lightgreen",
    water="lightblue",
    projection="M10c",
    frame="a",
)
fig.show()

###############################################################################
# Add a title
# -----------
#
# The ``frame`` parameter can be used to add a title to the figure. The title
# is set with by passing ``"+t"`` followed by the title (e.g. setting the map
# title to "Title" would be ``"+tTitle"``).
#
# To pass multiple arguments to ``frame``, a list can be used, as shown in the
# example below. This format uses ``frame`` to set both the axes annotations
# and the figure title.

fig = pygmt.Figure()
fig.coast(
    region=[-69, -68, 43.75, 44.75],
    shorelines=True,
    land="lightgreen",
    water="lightblue",
    projection="M10c",
    frame=["a", "+tMaine"],
)
fig.show()

# Additional exercises
# --------------------
#
# This is the end of the first tutorial. Here are some additional exercises
# for the concepts that were discussed:
#
# 1. Make a map of Germany using its ISO country code ("DE"). Pass the ISO
#    code as a Python string to the ``region`` parameter.
#
# 2. Change the color of the land to "khaki" and the water to "azure".
#
# 3. Change the color of the lakes (using the ``lakes`` parameter) to "red".
#
# 4. Create a global map. Set the region to "d" to center the map at the Prime
#    Meridian or "g" to center the map at the International Date Line. When the
#    region is set without using a list full of integers or floating numbers,
#    the argument needs to be passed as a Python string. Create a 15 centimeter
#    map using the Mollwide ("W") projection.
