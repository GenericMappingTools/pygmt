Intro to PyGMT
==============

Welcome to PyGMT! The tutorials in this intro are designed to teach basic
concepts to create maps in PyGMT.

**About this intro**

It is assumed that PyGMT has been successfully :doc:`installed </install>`
on your system. To test this, run ``import pygmt`` in a Python IDE or
`Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`__ notebook.

This intro will progressively cover PyGMT data manipulation and plotting
concepts, and later tutorials will use concepts explained in previous ones.
It will not cover all PyGMT functions and methods.
