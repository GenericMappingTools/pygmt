Intro to PyGMT
==============

Welcome to PyGMT! This tutorial is designed to teach the basic concepts to
make a map in PyGMT.

**About this tutorial**

This tutorial assumes that PyGMT has been successfully
:doc:`installed </install>`. A quick way to test this is to  type
``import pygmt`` in a Python IDE or
`Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`__ Notebook.

This tutorial will progressively cover PyGMT plotting concepts, and later
examples will use concepts explained in previous examples. It will not
cover all PyGMT methods.
