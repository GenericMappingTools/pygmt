Intro to PyGMT
==============

Welcome to PyGMT! The tutorials in this intro are designed to teach basic
concepts to create maps in PyGMT.

**About this intro**

It is assumed that PyGMT has been successfully :doc:`installed </install>`
on your system. To test this, run ``import pygmt`` in a Python IDE or
`Jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`__ notebook.

PyGMT can be used in both a Python script and a notebook environment, such
as Jupyter. The recommended method for these tutorials is to use a notebook,
as the code is set up for a notebook environment.

This intro will progressively cover PyGMT data manipulation and plotting
concepts, and later tutorials will use concepts explained in previous ones.
It will not cover all PyGMT functions and methods.
