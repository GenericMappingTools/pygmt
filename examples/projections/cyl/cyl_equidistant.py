Cylindrical equidistant
=======================

This simple cylindrical projection is really a linear scaling of longitudes and
latitudes. The most common form is the Plate Carr√©e projection, where the
scaling of longitudes and latitudes is the same. All meridians and parallels
are straight lines.

**q**\ [*lon0*/\ [*lat0*/]]\ *scale* or **Q**\ [*lon0*/\ [*lat0*/]]\ *width*

The projection is set with **q** or **Q**, and the figure size is set with
*scale* or *width*. Optionally, the central meridian can be set with *lon0*
[Default is the middle of the map]. Optionally, the standard parallel can
be set with *lat0* [Default is the equator]. When supplied, the central
meridian must be supplied as well.
