Eckert IV
=========

The Eckert IV projection, presented by the German cartographer Max
Eckert-Greiffendorff in 1906, is a pseudo-cylindrical equal-area projection. Central
meridian and all parallels are straight lines; other meridians are equally spaced
elliptical arcs. The scale is true along latitude 40°30’.

**kf**\ [*lon0/*]\ *scale* or **Kf**\ [*lon0/*]\ *width*

The projection is set with **kf** or **Kf**. The central meridian is set with the
optional *lon0*, and the figure size is set with *scale* or *width*.
