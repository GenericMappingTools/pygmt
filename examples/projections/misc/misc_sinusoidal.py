Sinusoidal
==========

The sinusoidal projection is one of the oldest known projections, is equal-area, and
has been used since the mid-16th century. It has also been called the
"Equal-area Mercator" projection. The central meridian is a straight line; all other
meridians are sinusoidal curves. Parallels are all equally spaced straight lines, with
scale being true along all parallels (and central meridian).

**i**\ [*lon0/*]\ *scale* or **I**\ [*lon0/*]\ *width*

The projection is set with **i** or **I**. The central meridian is set with the
optional *lon0*, and the figure size is set with *scale* or *width*.
