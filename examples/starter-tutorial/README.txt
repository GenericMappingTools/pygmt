Starter Tutorial
================

Welcome to PyGMT! This tutorial is designed to teach the basic concepts to
make a map in PyGMT.

About PyGMT
-----------

PyGMT is a Python wrapper for the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) software package.
GMT can be used for all types of plotting, but has a focus on scientific
mapping in the geoscience field. PyGMT adds to the mapping capabilities of GMT
by adding in the functionality of Python-specific packages, such as numpy,
pandas, and xarray, as well as includes the use of Jupyter notebooks.

About this tutorial
-------------------

This tutorial assumes that PyGMT has been successfully installed. A quick
way to test this is to type ``import pygmt`` in a Python IDE or Jupyter
Notebook.

This tutorial will progressively cover PyGMT plotting concepts, and later
examples will use concepts explained in previous examples. It will not
cover all PyGMT modules.
