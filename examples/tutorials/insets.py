"""
Adding an inset to the figure
=============================

To plot an inset figure inside another larger figure, we can use the
:meth:`pygmt.Figure.inset` method. After a large figure has been created,
call ``inset`` using a ``with`` statement, and new plot elements will be
added to the inset figure instead of the larger figure.

# Prior to creating an inset figure, a larger figure must first be plotted. In the
# example below, :meth:`pygmt.Figure.coast` is used to create a map of the US state of
# Massachusetts.

fig = pygmt.Figure()
fig.coast(
    region=[-74, -69.5, 41, 43],  # Set bounding box of the large figure
    borders="2/thin",  # Plot state boundaries with thin lines
    shorelines="thin",  # Plot coastline with thin lines
    projection="M15c",  # Set Mercator projection and size of 15 centimeter
    land="lightyellow",  # Color land areas light yellow
    water="lightblue",  # Color water areas light blue
    frame="a",  # Set frame with annotation and major tick spacing

# The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.inset` method uses a context manager, and is called using a
# ``with`` statement. The ``position`` parameter, including the inset width, is
# required to plot the inset. Using the **j** argument, the location of the inset is
# set to one of the 9 anchors (bottom-middle-top and left-center-right). In the
# example below, ``BL`` sets the inset to the bottom left. The ``box`` parameter can
# set the fill and border of the inset. In the example below, ``+pblack`` sets the
# border color to black and ``+gred`` sets the fill to red.

# When using **j** to set the anchor of the inset, the default location is in
# contact with the nearby axis or axes. The offset of the inset can be set with **+o**,
# followed by the offsets along the x- and y-axis. If only one offset is
# passed, it is applied to both axes. Each offset can have its own unit. In
# the example below, the inset is shifted 0.5 centimeters on the x-axis and
# 0.2 centimeters on the y-axis.
