# Plot Cartesian Vectors
# ----------------------
#
# Create a simple Cartesian vector using a starting point through
# ``x``, ``y``, and ``direction`` parameters.
# On the shown figure, the plot is projected on a 10cm X 10cm region,
# which is specified by the ``projection`` parameter.
# The direction is specified
# by a list of two 1d arrays structured as ``[[angle_in_degrees], [length]]``.
# The angle is measured in degrees and moves counter-clockwise from the
# horizontal.
# The length of the vector uses centimeters by default but
# could be changed using :meth:`pygmt.config`
# (Check the next examples for unit changes).
#
# Notice that the ``v`` in the ``style`` parameter stands for
# vector; it distinguishes it from regular lines and allows for
# different customization. ``0c`` is used to specify the size
# of the arrow head which explains why there is no arrow on either
# side of the vector.

# In this example, we apply the same concept shown previously to plot multiple
# vectors. Notice that instead of passing int/float to ``x`` and ``y``, a list
# of all x and y coordinates will be passed. Similarly, the length of direction
# list will increase accordingly.
#
# Additionally, we change the style of the vector to include a red
# arrow head at the end (**+e**) of the vector and increase the
# thickness (``pen="2p"``) of the vector stem. A list of different
# styling attributes can be found in
# :doc:`Vector heads and tails </gallery/lines/vector_heads_tails>`.

# Plot Circular Vectors
# ---------------------
#
# When plotting circular vectors, all of the information for a single vector is
# to be stored in a list. Each circular vector list is structured as:
# ``[x_start, y_start, radius, degree_start, degree_stop]``. The first two values in
# the vector list represent the origin of the circle that will be plotted.
# The next value is the radius which is represented on the plot in centimeters.
#
# The last two values in the vector list represent the degree at which the plot
# will start and stop. These values are measured counter-clockwise from the horizontal
# axis. In this example, the result show is the left half of a circle as the
# plot starts at 90 degrees and goes until 270. Notice that the ``m`` in the
# ``style`` parameter stands for circular vectors.
