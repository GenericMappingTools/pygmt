       Earth day/night dataset.


    This function downloads the dataset from the GMT data server, caches it in a user
    data directory (usually ``~/.gmt/server/earth/earth_day/``), and load the dataset as
    an :class:`xarray.DataArray`. An internet connection is required the first time
    around, but subsequent calls will load the dataset from the local data directory.

    The dataset can also be accessed by specifying a file name in any image processing
    function or plotting method, using the following file name format:
    **@earth_day**\_\ *res*. *res* is the image resolution. If *res* is omitted (i.e.,
    ``@earth_day``), GMT automatically selects a suitable resolution based on the
    current region and projection settings.

    Refer to :gmt-datasets:`earth-daynight.html` for more details about available
    datasets, including version information and references.

    Parameters
    ----------
    resolution
        The image resolution. The suffix ``d``, ``m``, and ``s`` stand for arc-degrees,
        arc-minutes, and arc-seconds.
    region
        The subregion of the image to load, in the form of a sequence [*xmin*, *xmax*,
        *ymin*, *ymax*].

    Returns
    -------
    image
        The NASA Blue Marble image. Coordinates are latitude and longitude in degrees.

    Note
    ----
    The registration and coordinate system type of the returned
    :class:`xarray.DataArray` image can be accessed via the GMT accessors (i.e.,
    ``image.gmt.registration`` and ``image.gmt.gtype`` respectively). However, these
    properties may be lost after specific image operations (such as slicing) and will
    need to be manually set before passing the image to any PyGMT data processing or
    plotting functions. Refer to :class:`pygmt.GMTDataArrayAccessor` for detailed
    explanations and workarounds.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> from pygmt.datasets import load_blue_marble
    >>> # Load the default image (pixel-registered 1 arc-degree image)
    >>> image = load_blue_marble()
