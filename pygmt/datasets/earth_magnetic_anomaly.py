    r"""
    Load an Earth magnetic anomaly grid in various resolutions.

    The grids are downloaded to a user data directory
    (usually ``~/.gmt/server/earth/earth_mag/`` or
    ``~/.gmt/server/earth/earth_mag4km/``) the first time you invoke
    this function. Afterwards, it will load the grid from the data directory.
    So you'll need an internet connection the first time around.

    These grids can also be accessed by passing in the file name
    **@**\ *earth_mag_type*\_\ *res*\[_\ *reg*] to any grid plotting/processing
    function. *earth_mag_type* is the GMT name
    for the dataset. The available options are **earth_mag** and
    **earth_mag4km**. *res* is the grid resolution (see below), and *reg* is
    grid registration type (**p** for pixel registration or **g** for gridline
    registration).

    Refer to :gmt-datasets:`earth-mag.html` for more details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    resolution : str
        The grid resolution. The suffix ``d`` and ``m`` stand for
        arc-degrees and arc-minutes. It can be ``"01d"``, ``"30m"``,
        ``"20m"``, ``"15m"``, ``"10m"``, ``"06m"``, ``"05m"``, ``"04m"``,
        ``"03m"``, or ``"02m"``.

    region : str or list
        The subregion of the grid to load, in the forms of a list
        [*xmin*, *xmax*, *ymin*, *ymax*] or a string *xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax*.
        Required for grids with resolutions higher than 5
        arc-minutes (i.e., ``"05m"``).

    registration : str
        Grid registration type. Either ``"pixel"`` for pixel registration or
        ``"gridline"`` for gridline registration. Default is ``None``, where
        a pixel-registered grid is returned unless only the
        gridline-registered grid is available.

    mag4km : bool
        Choose the data version to use. The default is ``False``, which is
        observed at sea level over oceanic regions and has no data over land.
        Set ``mag4km`` to ``True`` to use a version where all observations
        are relative to an altitude of 4 km above the geoid and include data
        over land.

    Returns
    -------
    grid : :class:`xarray.DataArray`
        The Earth magnetic anomaly grid. Coordinates are latitude and
        longitude in degrees. Units are in nano Teslas (nT).

    Note
    ----
    The :class:`xarray.DataArray` grid doesn't support slice operation, for
    Earth magnetic anomaly with resolutions of 5 arc-minutes or higher,
    which are stored as smaller tiles.
