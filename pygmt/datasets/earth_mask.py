       GSHHG Earth mask dataset.

    This function downloads the dataset from the GMT data server, caches it in a user
    data directory (usually ``~/.gmt/server/earth/earth_mask/``), and load the dataset
    as an :class:`xarray.DataArray`. An internet connection is required the first time
    around, but subsequent calls will load the dataset from the local data directory.

    The dataset can also be accessed by specifying a file name in any grid processing
    function or plotting method, using the following file name format:
    **@earth_mask**\_\ *res*\_\ *reg*. *res* is the grid resolution; *reg* is the grid
    registration type (**p** for pixel registration, **g** for gridline registration).
    If *reg* is omitted (e.g., ``@earth_mask_01d``), the gridline-registered grid will
    be loaded for grid processing functions and the pixel-registered grid will be
    loaded for plotting functions. If *res* is also omitted (i.e., ``@earth_mask``), GMT
    automatically selects a suitable resolution based on the current region and
    projection settings.

    Refer to :gmt-datasets:`earth-mask.html` for more details about available
    datasets, including version information and references.

    Parameters
    ----------
    resolution
        The grid resolution. The suffix ``d``, ``m``, and ``s`` stand for arc-degrees,
        arc-minutes, and arc-seconds.
    region
        The subregion of the grid to load, in the form of a sequence [*xmin*, *xmax*,
        *ymin*, *ymax*] or an ISO country code.
    registration
        Grid registration type. Either ``"pixel"`` for pixel registration or
        ``"gridline"`` for gridline registration.

    Returns
    -------
    grid
        The Earth mask grid. Coordinates are latitude and
        longitude in degrees. The node values in the mask grids are all in
        the 0-4 range and reflect different surface types:

        - 0: Oceanic areas beyond the shoreline
        - 1: Land areas inside the shoreline
        - 2: Lakes inside the land areas
        - 3: Islands in lakes in the land areas
        - 4: Smaller lakes in islands that are found within lakes
          inside the land area

    Note
    ----
    The registration and coordinate system type of the returned
    :class:`xarray.DataArray` grid can be accessed via the GMT accessors
    (i.e., ``grid.gmt.registration`` and ``grid.gmt.gtype`` respectively).
    However, these properties may be lost after specific grid operations (such
    as slicing) and will need to be manually set before passing the grid to any
    PyGMT data processing or plotting functions. Refer to
    :class:`pygmt.GMTDataArrayAccessor` for detailed explanations and
    workarounds.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> # Load the default grid (gridline-registered 1 arc-degree grid)
    >>> grid = load_earth_mask()
    >>> # location (120째E, 50째N) is in land area (1)
    >>> grid.sel(lon=120, lat=50).values
    array(1, dtype=int8)
    >>> # location (170째E, 50째N) is in oceanic area (0)
    >>> grid.sel(lon=170, lat=50).values
    array(0, dtype=int8)
