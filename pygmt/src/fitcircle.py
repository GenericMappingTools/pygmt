    Fit coordinators to create vectors on a sphere.

    **fitcircle** reads lon,lat [or lat,lon] values from the first two
    columns on standard input [or *table*]. These are converted to
    Cartesian three-vectors on the unit sphere. Then two locations are
    found: the mean of the input positions, and the pole to the great circle
    which best fits the input positions. The user may choose one or both of
    two possible solutions to this problem. When the data are closely grouped
    along a great circle both solutions are similar. If the data have large
    dispersion, the pole to the great circle will be less well determined
    than the mean. Compare both solutions as a qualitative check.

    Setting `normalize` to **1** approximates the
    minimization of the sum of absolute values of cosines of angular
    distances. This solution finds the mean position as the Fisher average
    of the data, and the pole position as the Fisher average of the
    cross-products between the mean and the data. Averaging cross-products
    gives weight to points in proportion to their distance from the mean,
    analogous to the "leverage" of distant points in linear regression in
    the plane.

    Setting `normalize` to **2** approximates the
    minimization of the sum of squares of cosines of angular distances. It
    creates a 3 by 3 matrix of sums of squares of components of the data
    vectors. The eigenvectors of this matrix give the mean and pole
    locations. This method may be more subject to roundoff errors when there
    are thousands of data. The pole is given by the eigenvector
    corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue; it is the least-well
    represented factor in the data and is not easily estimated by either
    method.

    Parameters
    ----------.
    output_type : str
        Determine the format the xyz data will be returned in [Default is
        ``pandas``]:

            - ``numpy`` - :class:`numpy.ndarray`
            - ``pandas``- :class:`pandas.DataFrame`
            - ``file`` - ASCII file (requires ``outfile``)
    outfile : str
        The file name for the output ASCII file.

    Returns
    -------
    ret : pandas.DataFrame or numpy.ndarray or None
        Return type depends on ``outfile`` and ``output_type``:

        - None if ``outfile`` is set (output will be stored in file set by
          ``outfile``)
        - :class:`pandas.DataFrame` or :class:`numpy.ndarray` if ``outfile`` is
          not set (depends on ``output_type`` [Default is
          :class:`pandas.DataFrame`])
