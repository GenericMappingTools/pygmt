    Compute the directional derivative of the vector gradient of the data.

    Can accept ``azimuth``, ``direction``, and ``radiance`` input to create
    the resulting gradient.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : str or xarray.DataArray
        The file name of the input grid or the grid loaded as a DataArray.
    outgrid : str or None
        The name of the output netCDF file with extension .nc to store the grid
        in.
    azimuth : int or float or str or list
        *azim*\ [/*azim2*].
        Azimuthal direction for a directional derivative; *azim* is the
        angle in the x,y plane measured in degrees positive clockwise from
        north (the +y direction) toward east (the +x direction). The
        negative of the directional derivative,
        :math:`-(\frac{{dz}}{{dx}}\sin(\mbox{{azim}}) + \
        \frac{{dz}}{{dy}}\cos(\mbox{{azim}}))`, is found; negation yields
        positive values when the slope of :math:`z(x,y)` is downhill in the
        *azim* direction, the correct sense for shading the illumination of an
        image by a light source above the x,y plane shining from the *azim*
        direction. Optionally, supply two azimuths, *azim*/*azim2*, in which
        case the gradients in each of these directions are calculated and the
        one larger in magnitude is retained; this is useful for illuminating
        data with two directions of lineated structures, e.g., *0*/*270*
        illuminates from the north (top) and west (left).  Finally, if *azim*
        is a file it must be a grid of the same domain, spacing and
        registration as *grid* that will update the azimuth at each output
        node when computing the directional derivatives.
    direction : str
        [**a**][**c**][**o**][**n**].
        Find the direction of the positive (up-slope) gradient of the data.
        The following options are supported:

        - **a** - Find the aspect (i.e., the down-slope direction)
        - **c** - Use the conventional Cartesian angles measured
          counterclockwise from the positive x (east) direction.
        - **o** - Report orientations (0-180) rather than directions (0-360).
        - **n** - Add 90 degrees to all angles (e.g., to give local strikes of
          the surface).
    radiance : str or list
        [**m**\|\ **s**\|\ **p**]\ *azim/elev*\ [**+a**\ *ambient*][**+d**\
        *diffuse*][**+p**\ *specular*][**+s**\ *shine*].
        Compute Lambertian radiance appropriate to use with
        :meth:`pygmt.Figure.grdimage` and :meth:`pygmt.Figure.grdview`. The
        Lambertian Reflection assumes an ideal surface that reflects all the
        light that strikes it and the surface appears
        equally bright from all viewing directions. Here, *azim* and *elev* are
        the azimuth and elevation of the light vector. Optionally, supply
        *ambient* [0.55], *diffuse* [0.6], *specular* [0.4], or *shine* [10],
        which are parameters that control the reflectance properties of the
        surface. Default values are given in the brackets. Use **s** for a
        simpler Lambertian algorithm. Note that with this form you only have
        to provide azimuth and elevation. Alternatively, use **p** for
        the Peucker piecewise linear approximation (simpler but faster
        algorithm; in this case *azim* and *elev* are hardwired to 315
        and 45 degrees. This means that even if you provide other values
        they will be ignored.).
    normalize : str or bool
        [**e**\|\ **t**][*amp*][**+a**\ *ambient*][**+s**\ *sigma*]\
        [**+o**\ *offset*].
        The actual gradients :math:`g` are offset and scaled to produce
        normalized gradients :math:`g_n` with a maximum output magnitude of
        *amp*. If *amp* is not given, default *amp* = 1. If *offset* is not
        given, it is set to the average of :math:`g`. The following forms are
        supported:

        - **True** - Normalize using :math:`g_n = \mbox{{amp}}\
          (\frac{{g - \mbox{{offset}}}}{{max(|g - \mbox{{offset}}|)}})`
        - **e** - Normalize using a cumulative Laplace distribution yielding:
          :math:`g_n = \mbox{{amp}}(1 - \
          \exp{{(\sqrt{{2}}\frac{{g - \mbox{{offset}}}}{{\sigma}}))}}`, where
          :math:`\sigma` is estimated using the L1 norm of
          :math:`(g - \mbox{{offset}})` if it is not given.
        - **t** - Normalize using a cumulative Cauchy distribution yielding:
          :math:`g_n = \
          \frac{{2(\mbox{{amp}})}}{{\pi}}(\tan^{{-1}}(\frac{{g - \
          \mbox{{offset}}}}{{\sigma}}))` where :math:`\sigma` is estimated
          using the L2 norm of :math:`(g - \mbox{{offset}})` if it is not
          given.

        As a final option, you may add **+a**\ *ambient* to add *ambient* to
        all nodes after gradient calculations are completed.
    tiles : str
        **c**\|\ **r**\|\ **R**.
        Controls how normalization via ``normalize`` is carried out.  When
        multiple  grids should be normalized the same way (i.e., with the same
        *offset*  and/or *sigma*),
        we must pass these values via ``normalize``.  However, this is
        inconvenient if we compute these values from a grid.  Use **c** to
        save  the results  of *offset* and *sigma* to a statistics file; if
        grid output is not  needed for this run then do not specify
        ``outgrid``. For  subsequent runs,  just use **r** to read these
        values.  Using **R**  will read then delete the statistics file.
    {region}
    slope_file : str
        Name of output grid file with scalar magnitudes of gradient vectors.
        Requires ``direction`` but makes ``outgrid`` optional.
    {verbose}
    {coltypes}
    {interpolation}

    Returns
    -------
    ret: xarray.DataArray or None
        Return type depends on whether the ``outgrid`` parameter is set:

        - :class:`xarray.DataArray` if ``outgrid`` is not set
        - None if ``outgrid`` is set (grid output will be stored in file set by
          ``outgrid``)


    Example
    -------
    >>> import pygmt
    >>> # Load a grid of @earth_relief_30m data, with an x-range of 10 to 30,
    >>> # and a y-range of 15 to 25
    >>> grid = pygmt.datasets.load_earth_relief(
    ...     resolution="30m", region=[10, 30, 15, 25]
    ... )
    >>> # Create a new grid from an input grid, set the azimuth to 10 degrees,
    >>> new_grid = pygmt.grdgradient(grid=grid, azimuth=10)
