    Perform histogram equalization for a grid.

    Two common use cases of :meth:`pygmt.grdhisteq` are to find data values
    that divide a grid into patches of equal area
    (:meth:`pygmt.grdhisteq.compute_bins`) or to write a grid with
    statistics based on some kind of cumulative distribution function using
    (:meth:`pygmt.grdhisteq.equalize_grid`).

    Histogram equalization provides a way to highlight data that has most
    values clustered in a small portion of the dynamic range, such as a
    grid of flat topography with a mountain in the middle. Ordinary gray
    shading of this grid (using :meth:`pygmt.Figure.grdimage` or
    :meth:`pygmt.Figure.grdview`) with a linear mapping from topography to
    graytone will result in most of the image being very dark gray, with the
    mountain being almost white. :meth:`pygmt.grdhisteq.compute_bins` can
    provide a list of data values that divide the data range into divisions
    which have an equal area in the image [Default is 16 if ``divisions`` is
    not set]. The :class:`pandas.DataFrame` or ASCII file output can be used to
    make a colormap with :meth:`pygmt.makecpt` and an image with
    :meth:`pygmt.Figure.grdimage` that has all levels of gray occuring
    equally.

    :meth:`pygmt.grdhisteq.equalize_grid` provides a way to write a grid with
    statistics based on a cumulative distribution function. In this
    application, the ``outgrid`` has relative highs and lows in the same
    (x,y) locations as the ``grid``, but the values are changed to reflect
    their place in the cumulative distribution.
