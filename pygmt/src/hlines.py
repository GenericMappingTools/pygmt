    Plot one or multiple horizontal line(s).

    This method is a high-level wrapper around :meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot` that focuses on
    plotting horizontal lines at Y-coordinates specified by the ``y`` parameter. The
    ``y`` parameter can be a single value (for a single horizontal line) or a sequence
    of values (for multiple horizontal lines).

    By default, the X-coordinates of the start and end points of the lines are set to
    be the X-limits of the current plot, but this can be overridden by specifying the
    ``xmin`` and ``xmax`` parameters. ``xmin`` and ``xmax`` can be either a single
    value or a sequence of values. If a single value is provided, it is applied to all
    lines. If a sequence is provided, the length of ``xmin`` and ``xmax`` must match
    the length of ``y``.

    The term "horizontal" lines can be interpreted differently in different coordinate
    systems:

    - **Cartesian** coordinate system: lines are plotted as straight lines.
    - **Polar** projection: lines are plotted as arcs along a constant radius.
    - **Geographic** projection: lines are plotted as parallels along constant latitude.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y
        Y-coordinates to plot the lines. It can be a single value (for a single line)
        or a sequence of values (for multiple lines).
    xmin/xmax
        X-coordinates of the start/end point(s) of the line(s). If ``None``, defaults to
        the X-limits of the current plot. ``xmin`` and ``xmax`` can be either a single
        value or a sequence of values. If a single value is provided, it is applied to
        all lines. If a sequence is provided, the length of ``xmin`` and ``xmax`` must
        match the length of ``y``.
    pen
        Pen attributes for the line(s), in the format of *width,color,style*.
    label
        Label for the line(s), to be displayed in the legend.
    no_clip
        If ``True``, do not clip lines outside the plot region. Only makes sense in the
        Cartesian coordinate system.
    perspective
        Select perspective view and set the azimuth and elevation angle of the
        viewpoint. Refer to :meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot` for details.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import pygmt
    >>> fig = pygmt.Figure()
    >>> fig.basemap(region=[0, 10, 0, 10], projection="X10c/10c", frame=True)
    >>> fig.hlines(y=1, pen="1p,black", label="Line at y=1")
    >>> fig.hlines(y=2, xmin=2, xmax=8, pen="1p,red,-", label="Line at y=2")
    >>> fig.hlines(y=[3, 4], xmin=3, xmax=7, pen="1p,black,.", label="Lines at y=3,4")
    >>> fig.hlines(y=[5, 6], xmin=4, xmax=9, pen="1p,red", label="Lines at y=5,6")
    >>> fig.hlines(
    ...     y=[7, 8], xmin=[0, 1], xmax=[7, 8], pen="1p,blue", label="Lines at y=7,8"
    ... )
    >>> fig.legend()
    >>> fig.show()
