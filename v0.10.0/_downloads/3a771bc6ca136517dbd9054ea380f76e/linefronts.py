Line fronts
-----------

Using the :meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot` method you can draw a so-called
*front* which allows to plot specific symbols distributed along a line
or curve. Typical use cases are weather fronts, fault lines,
subduction zones, and more. To draw general symbols along a line or
curve, i.e., a so-called *decorated line*, see the
:doc:`Decorated lines example </gallery/lines/decorated_lines>`.

A front can be drawn by passing **f**\[Â±]\ *gap*\[/*size*] to the ``style``
parameter where *gap* defines the distance gap between the symbols and
*size* the symbol size. If *gap* is negative, it is interpreted to mean
the number of symbols along the front instead. If *gap* has a leading +
then we use the value exactly as given [Default will start and end each
line with a symbol, hence the *gap* is adjusted to fit]. If *size* is
missing it is set to 30% of the *gap*, except when *gap* is negative
and *size* is thus required. Append **+l** or **+r** to plot symbols on
the left or right side of the front [Default is centered]. Append
**+**\ *type* to specify which symbol to plot: **b**\ ox, **c**\ ircle,
**f**\ ault [Default], **s**\ lip, or **t**\ riangle. Slip means left-lateral
or right-lateral strike-slip arrows (centered is not an option). The **+s**
modifier optionally accepts the angle used to draw the vector [Default is
20 degrees]. Alternatively, use **+S** which draws arcuate arrow heads.
Append **+o**\ *offset* to offset the first symbol from the beginning of
the front by that amount [Default is 0]. The chosen symbol is drawn with
the same pen as set for the line (i.e., via the ``pen`` parameter). To use
an alternate pen, append **+p**\ *pen*. To skip the outline, just use
**+p** with no argument. To make the main front line invisible, add **+i**.
For modifying the main front line via the ``pen`` parameter, see the
:doc:`Line styles example </gallery/lines/linestyles>`.
