Cartesian power
===============

**X**\ *width*\ [**p**\ *pvalue*][/*height*\ [**p**\ *pvalue*]] or
**x**\ *x-scale*\ [**p**\ *pvalue*][/*y-scale*\ [**p**\ *pvalue*]]

Give the *width* of the figure and the optional argument *height*.
The lower-case version **x** is similar to **X** but expects
an *x-scale* and an optional *y-scale*.
Each axis with a power transformation requires **p** and the exponent
for that axis after its size argument.
