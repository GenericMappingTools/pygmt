Lambert Conic Conformal Projection
==================================

This conic projection was designed by the Alsatian mathematician Johann
Heinrich Lambert (1772) and has been used extensively for mapping of regions
with predominantly east-west orientation, just like the Albers projection.
Unlike the Albers projection, Lambertâ€™s conformal projection is not equal-area.
The parallels are arcs of circles with a common origin, and meridians are the
equally spaced radii of these circles. As with Albers projection, it is only
the two standard parallels that are distortion-free.

**l**\ *lon0/lat0*\ /\ *lat1/lat2*\ */scale*
or **L**\ *lon0/lat0*\ /\ *lat1/lat2*\ */width*

The projection is set with **l** or **L**. The projection center is set by
*lon0/lat0* and two standard parallels for the map are set with *lat1/lat2*.
The figure size is set with *scale* or *width*.
