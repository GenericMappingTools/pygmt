Inset
=====

The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.inset` method adds an inset figure inside a larger
figure. The method is called using a ``with`` statement, and its
``position``, ``box``, ``offset``, and ``margin`` parameters are set. Plotting
methods called within the ``with`` statement are applied to the inset figure.
