Roads
=====

The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot` method allows us to plot geographical data such
as lines which are stored in a :class:`geopandas.GeoDataFrame` object. Use
:func:`geopandas.read_file` to load data from any supported OGR format such as
a shapefile (.shp), GeoJSON (.geojson), geopackage (.gpkg), etc. Then, pass the
:class:`geopandas.GeoDataFrame` as an argument to the ``data`` parameter of
:meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot`, and style the geometry using the ``pen`` parameter.
