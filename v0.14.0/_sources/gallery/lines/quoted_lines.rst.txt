Quoted lines
============

To plot a so-called *quoted line*, i.e., labels along a line
or curve, use the ``style`` parameter of the
:meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot` method with the argument ``"q"`` and the
desired modifiers. A colon (``":"``) is used to separate the
algorithm settings from the label information.
This example shows how to adjust the labels.
For modifying the main quoted line via the ``pen`` parameter,
see the :doc:`Line styles example </gallery/lines/linestyles>`.
For details on the input data see the upstream GMT documentation
at :gmt-docs:`plot.html#s`.

to the ``style`` parameter.
