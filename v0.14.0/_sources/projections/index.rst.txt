Projections
===========

PyGMT supports many map projections; see :doc:`/techref/projections` for an overview.
Use the ``projection`` parameter to specify which one you want to use in all plotting
methods. The projection is specified by a one-letter code along with (sometimes optional)
reference longitude and latitude and the width of the map (for example,
**A**\ *lon0/lat0*\ [*/horizon*\ ]\ */width*). The map height is determined based on the
region and projection.

These are all the available projections:

The projection acquired its name from the construction of each parallel, which is achieved by projecting the parallel onto the cone while it is rolled around the globe, along the central meridian, tangent to that parallel. As a consequence, the projection involves many cones rather than a single one used in regular conic projections.">

Such a line is called a rhumb line or loxodrome. Thus, to sail from one point to another one only had to connect the points with a straight line, determine the azimuth of the line, and keep this constant course for the entire voyage. The Mercator projection has been used extensively for world maps in which the distortion towards the polar regions grows rather large.">
