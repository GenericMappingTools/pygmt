Mollweide projection
====================

This pseudo-cylindrical, equal-area projection was developed by the German
mathematician and astronomer Karl Brandan Mollweide in 1805. Parallels are
unequally spaced straight lines with the meridians being equally spaced
elliptical arcs. The scale is only true along latitudes 40Â°44' north and south.
The projection is used mainly for global maps showing data distributions. It is
occasionally referenced under the name homalographic projection.

**w**\ [*lon0/*]\ *scale* or **W**\ [*lon0/*]\ *width*

The projection is set with **w** or **W**. The central meridian is set with the
optional *lon0*, and the figure size is set with *scale* or *width*.
