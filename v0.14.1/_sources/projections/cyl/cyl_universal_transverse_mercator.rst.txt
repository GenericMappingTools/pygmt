Universal Transverse Mercator projection
========================================

A particular subset of the
:doc:`transverse Merctor </projections/cyl/cyl_transverse_mercator>`
is the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) which was adopted by the US Army
for large-scale military maps. Here, the globe is divided into 60 zones
between 84째S and 84째N, most of which are 6째 (in longitude) wide.
Each of these UTM zones have their unique central meridian.
Furthermore, each zone is divided into latitude bands but these are
not needed to specify the projection for most cases. See Figure
:ref:`Universal Transverse Mercator <GMT_utm_zones>` for all zone designations.

   Universal Transverse Mercator zone layout.

In order to minimize the distortion in any given zone, a scale factor of 0.9996
has been factored into the formulae (although a standard, you can change this
with :gmt-term:`PROJ_SCALE_FACTOR`). This makes the UTM projection a *secant*
projection and not a *tangent* projection like the
:doc:`transverse Merctor </projections/cyl/cyl_transverse_mercator>`.
The scale only varies by 1 part in 1,000 from true scale at equator. The
ellipsoidal projection expressions are accurate for map areas that extend
less than 10째 away from the central meridian. For larger regions we use the
conformal latitude in the general spherical formulae instead.

**u**\ *zone/scale* or **U**\ *zone/width*

The projection is set with **u** or **U**. *zone* sets the zone for the figure,
and the figure size is set with *scale* or *width*.
