Hammer projection
=================

The equal-area Hammer projection, first presented by the German mathematician
Ernst von Hammer in 1892, is also known as Hammer-Aitoff (the Aitoff projection
looks similar, but is not equal-area). The border is an ellipse, equator and
central meridian are straight lines, while other parallels and meridians are
complex curves.

**h**\ [*lon0/*]\ *scale* or **H**\ [*lon0/*]\ *width*

The projection is set with **h** or **H**. The central meridian is set with the
optional *lon0*, and the figure size is set with *scale* or *width*.
