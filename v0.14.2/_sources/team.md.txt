# PyGMT Team

We are an international team dedicated to building a Pythonic API for the Generic Mapping
Tools (GMT).

All are welcome to become involved with the PyGMT project! For more information about how
to get involved, see the [](contributing.md). A more complete list of contributors
is available in the [`AUTHORS.md`](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt/blob/main/AUTHORS.md)
file in the source repository.

Distinguished Contributors are recognized for their substantial contributions to PyGMT,
which may include code, documentation, pull request review, triaging, forum responses,
community building and engagement, outreach, and inclusion and diversity. Maintainers
are recognized for their responsibilities in maintaining the project, as detailed in
the [](maintenance.md).

New Distinguished Contributors and Active Maintainers are selected and voted by current
Active Maintainers before each release. Maintainers that are inactive for more than one
year will be moved to Distinguished Contributors.
