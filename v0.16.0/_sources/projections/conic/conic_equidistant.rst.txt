Equidistant conic projection
============================

The equidistant conic projection was described by the Greek philosopher
Claudius Ptolemy about A.D. 150. It is neither conformal or equal-area, but
serves as a compromise between them. The scale is true along all meridians and
the standard parallels.

**d**\ *lon0/lat0*\ /\ *lat1/lat2*\ */scale*
or **D**\ *lon0/lat0*\ /\ *lat1/lat2*\ */width*

The projection is set with **d** or **D**. The projection center is set by
*lon0/lat0* and two standard parallels for the map are set with *lat1/lat2*.
The figure size is set with *scale* or *width*.
