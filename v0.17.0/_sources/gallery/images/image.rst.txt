Image on a figure
=================

The :meth:`pygmt.Figure.image` method can be used to read and place an image file in
many formats (e.g., png, jpg, eps, pdf) on a figure. We must specify the filename via
the ``imagefile`` parameter or simply use the filename as the first argument. You can
also use a full URL pointing to your desired image. The ``position`` parameter allows
us to set a reference point on the map for the image.
