Line colors with a custom CPT
-----------------------------

The color of the lines made by :meth:`pygmt.Figure.plot` can be set according to a
custom CPT and assigned with the ``pen`` argument.

The custom CPT can be used by setting the plot command's ``cmap`` argument to ``True``. The
``zvalue`` argument sets the z-value (color) to be used from the custom CPT, and the line
color is set as the z-value by using **+z** when setting the ``pen`` color.
