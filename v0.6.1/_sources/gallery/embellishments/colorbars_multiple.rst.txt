Multiple colormaps
------------------
This gallery example shows how to create multiple colormaps for different
subplots. To better understand how GMT modern mode maintains several levels of
colormaps, please refer to
:gmt-docs:`cookbook/features.html#gmt-modern-mode-hierarchical-levels` for
details.
