Universal Transverse Mercator
=============================

A particular subset of the transverse Mercator is the Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) which was adopted by the US Army for large-scale military maps.
Here, the globe is divided into 60 zones between 84°S and 84°N, most of which
are 6 wide. Each of these UTM zones have their unique central meridian.
Furthermore, each zone is divided into latitude bands but these are not needed
to specify the projection for most cases.

In order to minimize the distortion in any given zone, a scale factor of 0.9996
has been factored into the formulae. This makes the UTM projection a secant
projection and not a tangent projection like the transverse Mercator above. The
scale only varies by 1 part in 1,000 from true scale at equator. The
ellipsoidal projection expressions are accurate for map areas that extend less
than 10 away from the central meridian.

**u**\ *zone/scale* or **U**\ *zone/width*

the projection is set with **u** or **U**. *zone* sets the zone for the figure,
and the figure size is set with *scale* or *width*.
