1. Making your first figure
===========================

This tutorial page covers the basics of creating a figure using PyGMT - a
Python wrapper for the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT). It will only use
the ``coast`` method for plotting. Later examples will address other PyGMT
methods.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 12-18

Setting up the development environment
--------------------------------------

PyGMT can be used in both a Python script and a notebook environment, such
as Jupyter. The tutorial's recommended method is to use a notebook, and the
code will be for a notebook environment.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 21-26

Loading the library
-------------------

The first step is to import ``pygmt``. All methods and figure generation is
accessible from the :mod:`pygmt` top level package.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 26-29

.. code-block:: default


    import pygmt








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 31-36

Creating a figure
-----------------

All figure generation in PyGMT is handled by the :class:`pygmt.Figure` class.
Start a new figure by creating an instance of this class:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-39

.. code-block:: default


    fig = pygmt.Figure()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 40-59

To add to a plot object (``fig`` in this example), the PyGMT module is used
as a method on the class. This example will use the ``coast`` method, which
can be used to create a map without any other methods, modules or external
data. The ``coast`` method plots the coastlines, borders, and bodies of water
using a database that is included in GMT.

First, a region for the figure must be selected. This example will plot some
of the coast of Maine in the northeastern US. A Python list can be passed to
the ``region`` parameter with the minimum and maximum X-values (longitude)
and the minimum and maximum Y-values (latitude). For this example, the
minimum (bottom left) coordinates are (N43.75, W69) and the maximum (top
right) coordinates are (N44.75, W68). Negative values can be passed for
latitudes in the southern hemisphere or longitudes in the western hemisphere.

In addition to the region, an argument needs to be passed to ``coast`` to
tell it what to plot. In this example, ``coast`` will be told to plot the
shorelines by passing the Boolean value ``True`` to the ``shorelines``
parameter. The ``shorelines`` parameter has other options for finer control,
but setting it to ``True`` uses the default values.

    fig.coast(region=[-69, -68, 43.75, 44.75], shorelines=True)

Color the land and water
------------------------

This figure plots all of the coastlines in the given region, but it does not
indicate where the land and water are. Color values can be passed to ``land``
and ``water`` to set the colors on the figure.

When plotting colors in PyGMT, there are multiple
:gmt-docs:`color codes <gmtcolors.html>`, that can be used. This includes
standard GMT color names (like ``skyblue``), R/G/B levels (like ``0/0/255``),
a hex value (like ``#333333``), or a graylevel (like ``50``). For this
example, GMT color names are used.

Set the projection
------------------

This figure now has its colors set, but there is no projection or size
set for the map. Both of these values are set using the ``projection``
parameter.

The appropriate projection varies for the type of map. The available
projections are explained in the :doc:`projection </projections/index>`
gallery. For this example, the Mercator projection is set using ``"M"``.
The width of the figure will be 10 centimeters, as set by ``"10c"``. The map
size can also be set in inches using "i" (e.g. a 5 inch wide Mercator
projection would use ``"M5i"``).

Add a frame
-----------

While that the map's colors, projection, and size have been set, the region
that is being displayed is not apparent. A frame can be added to
annotate the latitude and longitude of the region.

The ``frame`` parameter is used to add a frame to the figure. For now, it
will be set to ``"a"`` to **a**\ nnotate the axes automatically.

Add a title
-----------

The ``frame`` parameter can be used to add a title to the figure. The title
is set with by passing ``"+t"`` followed by the title (e.g. setting the map
title to "Title" would be ``"+tTitle"``).

To pass multiple arguments to ``frame``, a list can be used, as shown in the
example below. This format uses ``frame`` to set both the axes gridlines and
the figure title.

Additional exercises
--------------------

This is the end of the first tutorial. Here are some additional exercises
for the concepts that were discussed:

1. Make a map of Germany using its ISO country code ("DE"). Pass the ISO
   code as a Python string to the ``region`` parameter.

2. Change the color of the land to "khaki" and the water to "azure".

3. Change the color of the lakes (using the ``lakes`` parameter) to "red".

4. Create a global map. Set the region to "d" to center the map at the Prime
   Meridian or "g" to center the map at the International Date Line. When the
   region is set without using a list full of integers or floating numbers,
   the argument needs to be passed as a Python string. Create a 15 centimeter
   map using the Mollwide ("W") projection.
